AB (1) This study assesses the frequency, rates of occurrence, and consequences of physical damage to individuals of nine canopy tree species in primary tropical rain forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. (2) For all species combined, frequency of damage varied from 9 to 27% among five size classes. Frequency of damage was negatively correlated with diameter growth rates for stems 1-30 cm in diameter. (3) Rates of damage due to falling litter ranged from 1 to 7% year-1 for trees up to 30 cm in diameter. Calculated half-lives until death or damage due to falling litter increased from 10 years for stems less-than-or-equal-to 1 cm in diameter to 63 years for stems 10-30 cm in diameter. (4) Rates of mortality were higher in damaged individuals than in undamaged plants for stems up to 10 cm in diameter. Absolute rates of mortality decreased with increasing stem diameter, but the relative contribution of physical damage as an agent of mortality increased with stem diameter. Litterfall caused at least 20% of the mortality of stems less-than-or-equal-to 1 cm in diameter, and accounted for 41% of the deaths of stems 1-30 cm in diameter. (5) Damage and death due to falling litter are important factors affecting plant regeneration throughout the humid neotropics. Future studies are likely to show that the same is true for temperate-zone closed-canopy forests.

AB This investigation was conducted as part of a continuing effort to develop a database on the chemistry of tree seeds. Seeds of Vochysia hondurensis Sprague were collected from three mature trees vigorously growing in a wet site, 400 m above sea level in San Ramon de la Virgen, Sarapiqui, Costa Rica. These were analyzed for starch, reducing and nonreducing sugars, total N (protein), amino N, total lipid, and fatty acids. The seeds contained high concentrations of lipids (28.6%) and protein (34%), but extremely low concentrations of carbohydrates (4.21%). Although 11 fatty acids were detected, three (oleic, arachidic, and cis-11-eicosenoic) comprised 80% of the total fatty acid weight. Based on these chemical contents, V. hondurensis seeds appear to exhibit orthodox behavior.

AB Tropical rain forest understories are extremely light-limited environments. Little is known about the demography of leaves in these habitats. To determine leaf longevity and causes of mortality for a species in the understory of a neotropical rain forest, we studied 634 leaves on 173 individuals of the cycad shrub Zamia skinneri for 10 yr at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Five different seasonal cohorts of leaves were followed. No significant differences among cohorts were found in median leaf longevity, but the cohorts did differ in the proportion of leaves dying in annual intervals from < 1 to greater-than-or-equal-to 6 yr. Median minimum time alive for all leaves was 4.6 yr. Epiphyll coverage increased from 0% in the first year of life to 75%-100% by year 4. Leaf mortality was well described by two separate exponential functions, approximately 10% mortality/yr until year 4, then abruptly increasing to ca. 51%/yr. Of 625 leaf deaths, 77.0% were due to unexplained causes, 16.5% to physical damage by falling litter, 4.8% to attacks by larvae of the lycaenid butterfly Eumaeus minyas, and 1.8% to other causes. Leaf longevity was positively correlated with leaf size. Individuals of Z. skinneri frequently survive more than a century in very dark understory conditions. We suggest that leaf longevity in these circumstances is determined by the inevitable deterioration in leaf carbon balance due to leaf aging and increasing epiphyll coverage, and by loss due to physical damage and attacks by the specialist herbivore.

AB Optimization of symbioses between plants and microbes has been suggested as a method for enhancing nutrient uptake in low-input agroecosystems. In general symbioses may be maximized through:  (1) the selection of plant cultivars responsive to symbionts; (2) inoculation with highly efficient strains of symbionts; (3) habitat modification to encourage symbioses. These methods were tested under a traditional, slash mulch 'frijol tapado' bean agroecosystem and/or a high-input ('espequeado') system to increase nodulation and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) of beans with the following results: (1) Under the espequeado system (modified by the exclusion of fertilizer application), four cultivars of indeterminate, vining dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) nodulated more than two determinate, bush varieties, especially under low available soil phosphorus (P). VAM levels were not statistically different under these conditions. (2) Under the tapado system, pelletization with rock phosphate and Rhizobium inoculum did not significantly change nodule biomass, dinitrogen (N2)-fixation or yield. (3) Without P application, neither nodulation nor % VAM were significantly different between the two systems of bean production. However, as applied P increased, differences in % VAM of the two systems became significant, decreasing more sharply with increasing P in the tapado system.
   The tripartite symbiosis of beans can be influenced by various factors such as cultivar, nutrient application and production system. Although traditional varieties and systems may optimize certain microbial symbioses, the quantity of the symbiosis appears to depend on a number of complex factors. An intermediate agricultural technology, the mixing of traditional and modem, is exemplified here by the application of moderate levels of fertilizer to the traditional, tapado system. This intermediate approach promises to decrease inputs in comparison to the espequeado system, as well as the need for shift cultivation, but long-term testing is needed.

AB To assess the diversity of tropical tree life histories, a conceptual framework is needed to guide quantitative comparative study of many species. We propose one such framework, which focuses on long-term performance through ontogeny and over the natural range of microsites. For 6 yr we annually evaluated survival, growth, and microsite conditions of six non-pioneer tree species in primary tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species were: Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, Hyeronima alchorneoides (all emergents), and Minquartia guianensis (a canopy species). The study was based on long-term measurement of individuals from all post-seedling size classes. Trees were sampled from 150 ha of primary forest spanning several watersheds and soil types. To evaluate individuals' microsites we recorded the number of overtopping crowns, forest phase (gap, building, mature), and crown illumination index (an estimate of the tree's light environment). For comparison, we also evaluated the microsites of three species that have been categorized as pioneers (Cecropia insignis, C obtusifolia) or high-light demanders (Simarouba amara).
   For the six species of non-pioneers, mortality rates declined with increasing juvenile size class. As a group, these emergent and canopy trees showed a much lower exponential annual mortality rate (0.44%/yr at > 10 cm diameter) than has been found for the La Selva forest as a whole. Growth rates increased with juvenile size class for all six species. As adults (trees > 30 cm in diameter), all five emergent species showed substantial annual diameter increments (medians of 5-14 mm/yr). Small saplings and adults of all species had significant year-to-year variation in diameter growth, with much greater growth occurring in the year of lowest rainfall. Passage time analysis suggests that all six species require > 150 yr for growth from small saplings to the canopy.
   Evaluation of all nine species revealed four patterns of microsite occupancy by juveniles. Among the non-pioneers, one species pair (Lecythis and Minquartia: Group A) was associated with low crown illumination and mature-phase forest in all juvenile stages. For two species (Dipteryx and Hymenolobium: Group B) the smallest saplings were in predominantly low-light, mature-forest sites, but crown illumination and association with gap- or building-phase sites increased with juvenile size (Simarouba also showed this pattern). Two species (Pithecellobium and Hyeronima: Group C) were strongly associated with gap or building phase as small juveniles (less-than-or-equal-to 4 cm diameter) and again as subcanopy trees (> 10 - 20 cm diameter), but were predominantly in mature-phase sites at intermediate sizes. Juveniles of the two pioneer species (Cecropia: Group D) showed the highest crown illumination and association with gap or building sites.
   Among the six non-pioneer species, only one aspect of juvenile performance clearly varied according to microsite group. The smallest saplings (less-than-or-equal-to 1 cm diameter) of Groups B and C showed significant mortality differences across a small gradient in crown illumination; neither of the Group A species showed this pattern. Otherwise, juvenile performance was strikingly similar among the six species. All showed a capacity for growth responses to small increases in light, substantial height and diameter increments at higher light levels, equal ability to survive 4-yr periods of no growth, and very low mortality rates at intermediate-to-large juvenile sizes. Species differed significantly in growth rates, but relative differences shifted with tree size and were unrelated to microsite group. These findings do not support prevailing paradigms concerning trade-offs and correlated suites of traits. For non-pioneer tropical trees, life history classification based on generalized concepts such as gap dependence and shade tolerance is inadequate to describe the complex size-dependent patterns of life history differences and similarities that exist among species.

AB Nitrous oxide production was measured in intact cores taken from active pasture and old-growth forest Inceptisols in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica. Following additions of aqueous KNO3 or glucose, or the two combined amendments, the cores were incubated in the laboratory to determine if N2O production rates were either N-limited or C-limited in the two land use types. Differences in rates of denitrification (N2O + N-2 production) among amended forest and pasture soils were determined by addition of 10% C2H2.
   The forest soils were relatively insensitive to all amendment additions, including the acetylene block. Forest N2O production rates among the treatments did not differ from the controls, and were consistently lower than those of the pasture soils. With the addition of glucose plus nitrate to the forest soils, production of N2O was three times greater than the controls, although this increase was not statistically significant. On the other hand, the pasture soils were definitely nitrogen-limited since N2O production rates were increased substantially beyond controls by all the amendments which contained nitrate, despite the very low N level (5 mg N kg(-1) soil) relative to typical fertilizer applications. With respect to the nitrate plus glucose plus acetylene treatment, denitrification was high in the pasture soils; N2O production in the presence of C2H2 was 150% of the rate of N2O production measured in the absence of the acetylene block. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of agricultural land use practices and subsequent impacts of disturbance on N2O release.

AB Natural-grown and young (5.5 year old) plantation-grown trees were sampled for two Central American hardwood species: Hyeronima alchorneoides and Vochysia guatemalensis in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica. Increment cores extracted at a height of 1.3 m from trees were divided into 1 cm segments from pith to bark. Basic specific gravity was calculated for each segment. Using the same cores, fibre length was measured from macerations for five natural and plantation-grown trees of each species. Number of vessels/mm2 and vessel tangential diameter were measured from segment cross sections for five natural-grown trees of each species.
   Specific gravity increased radially from pith to bark for both species; ranging from 0.23 to 0.70 (natural) and 0.23 to 0.50 (plantation) for Hyeronima; and from 0.27 to 0.51 (natural) and 0.26 to 0.38 (plantation) for Vochysia. Natural-grown trees of both species had significant tree-to-tree variation in specific gravity (p > .0.001).
   Fibre length increased radially from pith to bark for natural and plantation trees of both species; ranging from 1.92 to 2.98 mm (natural) and 1.45 to 2.71 mm (plantation) for Hyeronima; and from 0.63 to 1.75 mm (natural) and 0.69 to 1.47 mm (plantation) for Vochysia. Neither species had a clearly defined juvenile wood zone. Both specific gravity and fibre length continued to increase with distance from pith.

AB Seeds of Virola koschnyi Warb. (Myristicaceae) were collected at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (10-degrees-26'N, 83-degrees-59'W). The effect of seed size on germination and seedling vigor was studied. Germination tests conducted in the nursery demonstrated that seed mass does not significantly (F, P> 0.05) affect germination percentage, peak value and germination value. Vigor was studied using stem length, root length, leaf area and dry weight (stem, root and total). Statistical tests demonstrated that seed size significantly affected (Tukey, P< 0.01) plant vigor. Seeds with greater mass produced more vigorous plants. The importance of selecting seed for nursery production of this species is discussed.

AB Daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was monitored for 1 year in the understorey of a tropical wet forest along a transect extending from a treefall gap to the closed canopy at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Quantum sensors attached to data loggers were operated continuously. Hemispherical photographs were taken monthly above the sensors. An additional quantum sensor was used to monitor PPFD outside the canopy. Sensor measurements show large differences between gap and closed-canopy locations and high daily and seasonal variability at each sensor location, with notable increases in solar radiation in gap stations during September and April. The photographs demonstrate that seasonal variation in PPFD results primarily from shifts in the solar angle relative to canopy openings and secondarily from variation in PPFD levels outside the canopy (cloudiness). Photographs also demonstrate an overall decrease in PPFD with time, for the gap stations, owing to vegetation regrowth. Analyses reveal excellent agreement between sensor PPFD measurements and estimates from hemispherical photographs. Long-term monitoring of PPFD enables calibration of hemispherical photography to permit estimation of PPFD with a high degree of reliability.

AB The parasitic plant Helosis cayennensis (Swartz) Sprengel is composed of a sub-spherical tuber (diameter up to 6 cm) and slender runners (1-7 mm in diameter) which bear inflorescences. The tuber has no typical stem or root organization, no apical meristem or leaf primordia, no typical epidermis or stomata. The tuber consists of a parenchyma matrix and a network of vascular bundles, with sclereids especially abundant 1 to 2 mm below the tuber surface. At the interface between host root and parasite tuber, H. cayennensis parenchyma cells are large (mean diameter = 41.6 +/- 6.5 mum [SD]) and cytoplasmic, with large nuclei (mean diameter = 15.2 +/- 1.6 mum [SD]), which are larger than those of the host (29.1 +/- 6.2 mum [SD] and 4.5 +/- 0.8 mum [SD], respectively). Host and parasite vessel members can be distinguished by secondary wall ingrowths: host vessels have smooth secondary walls whereas H. cayennensis vessels have irregular secondary wall ingrowths. Vessel-vessel contact occurs at the host/parasite interface. We detected no parasite sieve plates at the host/parasite interface. Beyond the host/parasite interface, no host tissue can be seen in the parasite portion of the tuber. Vascular bundles branch in all directions in the tuber and undergo secondary growth. Primary xylem vessels have numerous wall ingrowths; secondary xylem vessels have only a few small peg-like ingrowths or have completely smooth walls. Sieve plates are simple, located at the end walls, and compound sieve areas occur on the side walls of the sieve tube members. There are many densely cytoplasmic cells, with large nuclei (mean diameter = 22.2 +/- 3.5 mum [SD]), around or within young vascular bundles. Tubers grow by the proliferation of parenchyma cells, which occurs diffusely throughout the ground matrix. Tubers produce runners that are cylindrical and branch irregularly. Runner primordia, initiated either in tubers or in older runners, are rootlike but with no root cap and no endodermis. There is no volva or significant rupturing of the parental tuber or runner. The runner apical meristem consists of a tunica of 3-6 layers of tannin-filled cells surrounding a corpus of tannin-free cells. The vascular tissue of runners is a eustele of 5-7 bundles. The pith of the runner is composed of fiber-like sclereids, and medullary rays differentiate into a sclerenchyma bridge between the pith and the brachysclereid bundle caps. The highly reduced vegetative body, which is a mixture of various characters of different organs, is interpreted in terms of homeotic morphogenesis.

AB Models of gap-phase regeneration in tropical wet forests are based primarily on studies of canopy trees. These paradigms are derived from studies of a small number of species whose life history traits place them easily into ''pioneer'' or ''climax'' species. Woody plants of the forest understory, subcanopy trees and shrubs, are known to affect significantly regeneration dynamics in treefall gaps, yet we lack fundamental information on life history characteristics of understory plants that could permit their incorporation into gap regeneration models. We investigated intra- and interspecific variability in early life history characteristics of understory Melastomataceae species of different growth forms and adult distributions from the lowland tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We examined germination patterns in vitro (22 species), effects on germination of passage through birds (5 species), seedling establishment in the field (3 species), and growth in different light environments (8 species).
   Established seedlings were significantly more abundant in gaps than in nearby understory sites. This pattern was generally applicable to all melastomes studied, regardless of the habitat where adults were normally most abundant. Seedlings were more common in the root pits and on the root mounds of uprooted trees, even though there was less light available to the seedlings in these microsites than elsewhere in the gaps. In a series of germination trials in vitro, most seeds germinated readily within 1-2 wk. Comparisons of germination rates between seeds collected from bird droppings and seeds extracted from fruits by hand gave varied results. With one exception, seeds of shade-tolerant species germinated more slowly following passage through birds, while seeds from high-light-demanding species germinated more rapidly after passing through birds.
   Seeds of three common species were sown directly into different microsites within gaps and understory control sites. In contrast to the germination trials, emergence percentages in the field ranged from 4% in understory sites to 21% in gap centers. Survival after 1 yr was low (0.1%-0.4%). After 1 yr, these seedlings were small (< 2 cm tall) and produced few leaves. In similar light environments in the shade-house, melastome seedling survival was between 80% and 100%, and growth increased with increasing light levels from 2% (corresponding to understory sites) to 20% (small gap centers) of full sun. With the exception of two species common to abandoned pastures and river banks, the species used in the shade-house growth experiments did not show significant increases in growth with increases in light from 20% to 40%. Suites of early life history traits described for tropical tree species are not consistent with the variation in pattern seen within this one family of understory species.

AB We examined the hypothesis that tropical rain forest tree species differ significantly in the degree to which their regeneration is associated with treefall gaps. Using static and dynamic analyses, we evaluated crown light environments and forest structure around 0.5-5 m tall saplings (N = 424) of two pioneer and seven nonpioneer tree species in old growth tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Canopy photographs were taken with a fisheye lens directly above all individuals, Each photograph was analyzed to calculate a Global Site Factor (GSF), which is analogous to the percentage of photosynthetically active radiation reaching a site relative to a totally open site. The amount and directionality of crown illumination were also estimated visually using a crown position index (Dawkins & Field 1978, Clark & Clark 1992). Forest structure around each individual, a reflection of local disturbance history, was categorized as gap, building, or mature.
   Saplings of all nine species were found in relatively dark sites (xBAR Global Site Factors 1.9-10.8%). The two pioneer species (Cecropia) were found in higher light microsites than the other species and were significantly different from each other. There were no significant differences in GSF among nonpioneer species. Results were similar for the direct and diffuse components of GSF, and for the crown position index. In contrast, forest structure around saplings varied significantly among nonpioneer species but not between Cecropia species.
   For six of the nine species short-term height or diameter growth was correlated with GSF or its direct or diffuse components. GSF was weakly but significantly correlated with sapling height and crown position.
   Analyses over time showed that all nine species had progressively lower crown illumination and fewer individuals in gap/building sites for 2-8 yr after initial encounter. Particularly steep decreases for Hyeronima and Pithecellobium saplings indicate that these species establish under canopy openings that subsequently fill in.
   Canopy photography, crown position index, and the forest structure index all provided ecologically interpretable information. Only canopy photography distinguished between microsites of the two Cecropia species. Forest structure and crown position indices are rapid and inexpensive methods for obtaining long-term information on microhabitats around individual trees.
   We found significant interspecific differentiation in microhabitat occupancy along a light gradient of only 0-25 percent of full sun. A crude 3-point index of forest structure revealed even further resolution. This study focused on only three microsite variables and a restricted size range of saplings. Comprehensive understanding of tropical tree regeneration will require long-term concurrent measurements of individual performance and associated environmental variables for all size classes of a broad range of species.

ID OMBROPHYTUM-SUBTERRANEUM BALANOPHORACEAE
AB Langsdorffia hypogaea Martius consists of a vegetative body, called a tuber, and inflorescences. The tuber is wide at regions that are close to the tuber/host root junction, and becomes cylindrical and branched, bearing inflorescences at branch ends. On the tuber, there are no detectable apical meristems, leaves or roots. Although there are no stomata, the tuber surface appears to be a true epidermis with regularly arranged ordinary cells. Trichomes densely cover the tuber branches and become broken as the branches enlarge in diameter, which causes the tuber surface to stretch, tear and expose underlying tissues. Brachysclereids are scattered within the tuber, being especially abundant in a band below the surface. There are two types of vascular systems in the tuber: composite bundles which consist of both host and Langsdorffia tissues, and bundles which consist of only Langsdorffia vascular tissues. Composite bundles consist of host vascular tissues, large transfer cells within the xylem, and a sheath of parenchyma. Nuclei of transfer cells and parenchymatous sheath cells are characteristic of Langsdorffia: large and heterochromatic, whereas nuclei of the vascular tissues are characteristic of the host: small and lightly stained. The composite bundles extend from the host root into only the broader parts of the tuber, but the purely Langsdorffia vascular bundles occur as a eustele and extend to the ends of tuber branches. These two vascular systems form complex, integrated networks. The purely Langsdorffia vascular bundles do not have direct contact with host vascular tissues as occurs in Helosis and Ombrophytum, two other genera of Balanophoraceae; instead, they connect with Langsdorffia tracheary elements that differentiate in the sheath of the composite bundles. Tuber growth consists of 1) increase of tuber diameter, 2) extension and ramification of branches, and 3) growth of composite bundles. Tuber diameter is increased by growth regions inside the sclereid band. Although there were no densely cytoplasmic meristematic regions at the ends of tuber branches, the eustelic organization of vascular bundles indicates there should have been meristems; they may have disorganized before we collected our plant. In composite bundles, host vascular tissues can undergo secondary growth. In addition, composite bundles have their own apical meristems, which grow intrusively into tuber ground matrix toward the tuber periphery and branch ends. The composite bundle apex is composed of two types of cells: one is large, with heterochromatic nuclei (Langsdorffia cells); the other is small, with euchromatic nuclei (host cells). It is unlikely that two meristematic groups grow as coordinately as we observed in the composite bundle apices without one displacing the other out of the apex. We suggest that, at the composite bundle apex, large Langsdorffia cells divide and intrude into the host meristematic region, resulting a ''chimeral'' apex.

AB Experiments were established on fertile soil in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica to examine the effects of complementary use of resources between species and stand turnover time on sustainability.  The experimental plantations are dominated by perennial plants of the two most successful life forms in this biome, dicotyledonous trees and self-supporting monocots, and are harvested and replanted at intervals of 1, 4, and 16 years.  Three main categories of responses are under study, including soil fertility, plant-pest interactions, and productivity.  Nitrogen is abundant in the study-site soil; nitrogen mineralization rates are about 0.85 kg ha-1 day-1 and nitrification rates are about 1.0 kg ha-1 day-1.  Phosphorus is also abundant (30 to 70 mug/g, Olsen extractable), and preliminary data indicate that much of the organically bound phosphorus is under microbial control.  Root systems of the three main tree species under study differ greatly, ranging from a dense, compact mass of roots (in Hyeronima alchorneoides) that thoroughly exploit a modest soil volume, to sparse roots that extend very far from the base of the tree (in Cordia alliodora), to massive starch-rich roots that enable the tree to respond to herbivore attack (in Cedrela odorata).

AB We compared soil phosphorus levels below canopies of the lowland tropical rain forest tree species Simarouba amara Aubl.  with soil sampled beyond the edge of S. amara canopies.  Our data show that trees affect soil phosphorus concentrations and that differences below individual trees are related to gender for this dioecious species.  Soil sampled adjacent to female trees had significantly higher soil phosphorus levels for several different indices of phosphorus availability than soil sampled beyond tree crowns.  Male trees did not significantly modify soil phosphorus levels.  Analysis of total mineral phosphorus (Total-phosphorus) below and beyond the canopies of male and female of S. amara found no differences in the total amount of phosphorous combined within bound and labile soil fractions.  We measured a small increase in soil organic matter under tree canopies, but found no gender-related difference.  Our results indicate that increased phosphorus availability beneath female S. amara arises from a gender-related modification in phosphorus cycling rather than from higher recruitment of females on sites rich in phosphorus or organic matter.  We suggest that gender-dependent controls on soil phosphorus may include below-canopy enrichment of available phosphorus due to fruit and litter cycling or increases in phosphorus transformation from bound to labile forms.

   2 Adult diameter increments varied markedly from year to year for all species. In the year of highest growth for individual species, mean increments were 25-112% greater than in the year of least growth. These among-year differences were significant for five of the six species.
   3 The variation in adult growth rates showed strong temporal concordance across species. For all six species, mean adult diameter increments were higher than average in 1985 and were lower than average in 1986 and 1988.
   4 Marked year to year growth differences were also shown by juvenile trees of these species. In the class greater than or equal to 50 cm tall and less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter, mean diameter increments were 3-10 times greater in the year of highest growth than in the year of least growth. In each of the other two juvenile size classes (1-10 cm and 10-30 cm in diameter), two species showed highly significant among-year growth variation.
   5 Within all three juvenile size classes, the year to year growth variation showed significant temporal concordance across species. As for adults, 1985 and/or 1984 were among the two highest growth years.
   6 That these patterns of interyear growth differences were shared across tree species and between saplings and adults demonstrates significant impacts of climatic variability on the productivity of this 'equable' ecosystem.
   7 Annual rainfall was not correlated with the annual growth patterns. Although the two years of highest overall growth, 1984 and 1985, were exceptionally dry, adult trees of two species showed their greatest growth in one of the highest rainfall years (1990).
   8 Recent studies suggest that photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) controls productivity of tropical wet forests. Recent data from La Selva show strong year to year variation in monthly PAR. Demonstration of a causal relationship will, however, require concurrent measurement of tree growth, PAR, and other climatic factors.
   9 Marked temporal variation in tree growth in tropical wet forests will have pervasive consequences for many processes in these complex ecosystems. Moreover, the degree of climatic sensitivity found in this study indicates that tropical rain forests could be strongly affected by global climate change.

AB We measured CO2 efflux from stems of two tropical wet forest trees, both found in the canopy, but with very different growth habits. The species were Simarouba amara, a fast-growing species associated with gaps in old-growth forest and abundant in secondary forest, and Minquartia guianensis, a slow-growing species tolerant of low-light conditions in old-growth forest. Per unit of bole surface, CO2 efflux averaged 1.24 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for Simarouba and 0.83 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for Minquartia. CO2 efflux was highly correlated with annual wood production (r(2) = 0.65), but only weakly correlated with stem diameter (r(2) = 0.22). We also partitioned the CO2 efflux into the functional components of construction and maintenance respiration. Construction respiration was estimated from annual stem dry matter production and maintenance respiration by subtracting construction respiration from the instantaneous CO2 flux. Estimated maintenance respiration was linearly related to sapwood volume (39.6 mu mol m(-3) s(-1) at 24.6 degrees C, r(2) = 0.58), with no difference in the rate for the two species. Maintenance respiration per unit of sapwood volume for these tropical wet forest trees was roughly twice that of temperate conifers. A model combining construction and maintenance respiration estimated CO2 very well for these species (r(2) = 0.85). For our sample, maintenance respiration was 54% of the total CO2 efflux for Simarouba and 82% for Minquartia. For our sample, sapwood volume averaged 23% of stem volume when weighted by tree size, or 40% with no size weighting. Using these fractions, and a published estimate of aboveground dry-matter production, we estimate the annual. cost of woody tissue respiration for primary forest at La Selva to be 220 or 350 g C m(-2) year(-1), depending on the assumed sapwood volume. These costs are estimated to be less than 13% of the gross production for the forest.

All species showed a similar association with an ascomycete that traversed the root hairs and formed intracellular hyphal coils within cytoplasmic epidermal and outer cortical cells. The unbranched fungal hyphae were of a uniform diameter. They were surrounded by a flocculent matrix material and by the host plasmalemma. Cytoplasmic hyphae also occurred within degenerated host cells. The host-fungus interaction showed similarities to Ericoid mycorrhizae.

AB To explore the potential of native tropical hardwoods for forestry development, 84 timber species were tested in a species screening trial in Costa Rica; 17 were widely planted tropical exotics, 52 were locally indigenous, and 15 were native to other areas of Costa Rica. A complete randomized block design was used with single tree plots replicated 24 times per site. At 3 years of age, survival, form, and growth were analyzed for species at four abandoned pasture sites at La Selva Biological Station, Sarapiqui, Costa Rica. Well-known exotics selected for fast growth made up 20% of the species tested but 40% of the fastest growing ten species. Of the top 25% of the species, 67% were indigenous species, in line with the original proportion tested. Candidate species for further testing were grouped according to different forestry objectives: timber plantations, agroforestry systems, enrichment plantings, and reforestation of buffer zones. These previously untested, little-known species demonstrate the large number of native species with high potential for reforestation for a variety of objectives.

AB Leaf optical properties (400-1,100 nm) were compared for four species of rain forest trees with crowns in understory, mid-canopy, and canopy positions to test whether optical properties change with light environment. The species tested represent a spectrum of regeneration patterns ranging from shade tolerant to light demanding. Overall, leaf optical properties of the four species were similar. Differences in absorptance were small, but statistically significant among the species and positions along the canopy gradient. Species absorptance differences corresponded somewhat to shade tolerance; two of the shade species showed higher absorptance in lower light environments, while the sun species showed the reverse pattern. Specific leaf mass (leaf weight per unit area) and chlorophyll content per unit leaf weight also changed along the canopy gradient. Specific leaf mass was positively correlated and chlorophyll per unit leaf weight was negatively correlated with increasing light environment. Consequently, the efficiency of absorption, as represented by the absorptance per unit leaf weight, increased as light level decreased, largely due to changes in specific leaf mass. In contrast, efficiency of absorption per unit leaf chlorophyll was relatively constant with light environment for the two species measured for chlorophyll.

AB We studied the landscape-level spatial variation in distribution and abundance of seven species of canopy and subcanopy palms in a neotropical rain forest. Within 568 ha of nonswamp old-growth lowland forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we sampled at 516 intersections of a reserve-wide grid to systematically assess the species' distributions across the major edaphic gradients. We found mosaics of community structure related to marked within-forest variability in both soil and topography. Total stem density of this guild varied with both edaphic factors. Steep sites had twice as many large palms (>10 m tall) per hectare than those on gentler topography or at lower slope positions. The combined density of subcanopy and canopy palms also varied significantly among soil types in the smallest size class (1-5 m tall), but not for larger individuals. Local (point) species richness of the subcanopy and canopy palms varied among soil types.
   Of the seven species, two (Astrocaryum alatum and A. confertum) were rare. All others showed significant edaphic variation in their distribution and/or estimated density. Two closely related species had strong and opposite edaphic associations. Euterpe macrospadix was biased toward steep topography and less fertile sites. Prestoea decurrens was nearly ommipresent on soil types with gentle topography while absent from half the points on soils with steep slopes. Two other closely related species, Iriartea deltoidea and Socratea exorrhiza, while virtually omnipresent across soil types and topographic positions, showed marked reciprocal variation in density between related soils. Iriartea's spatial distribution further indicates local removal of this species from one sector of the old growth by human harvesting (with subsequent apparent ''release'' of Socratea in this site). The most abundant species, Welfia georgii, while present at all sample points, showed significant among-soil variation in density.
   This substructuring of the arborescent palm guild results from the interplay of edaphic variation and past human activity. These findings and evidence from other sites suggest that marked spatial heterogeneity in community structure, at small to large scales (0.5-10(3) ha), may be general among tropical wet forests. Study of the spatial scales and causes of this variability will produce a more robust understanding of these complex ecosystems.

AB At sites in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica, clearing and burning of a secondary tropical rain forest caused a significant increase in soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Soil-atmosphere NO fluxes averaged 0.5 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) prior to clearing and increased to 4.1 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) following clearing and to greater than 12.0 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) following burning. Soil NO emissions were elevated for a period of 3-4 months following clearing, and fluxes peaked for 1-3 days following burning. We conducted a series of experiments with intact soil cores to determine the probable mechanism responsible for elevated NO emissions from soils. In one set of experiments we added substrates for microbial nitrification (ammonium), denitrification (nitrate), and chemical denitrification (nitrite) to autoclaved (killed) and nonautoclaved (live) soil cores. Water-only additions were used as controls. Compared to water or nitrate additions, ammonium caused a significant increase in NO emissions from live cores. Water, ammonium, and nitrate additions had no effect on emissions from autoclaved cores. Nitrite solution additions resulted in highly significant increases in NO emissions from both autoclaved and nonautoclaved soil cores. In a second set of experiments we treated intact soil cores with acetylene (1 kPa C2H2) to selectively inhibit nitrification and oxygen to inhibit denitrification. The oxygen treatment had no effect on NO production while acetylene significantly reduced NO emissions. The results from the substrate addition and inhibition experiments demonstrate that microbial denitrification is not a major pathway for NO production in these soils. In contrast, microbial nitrification appears to be a critical process responsible for NO emissions throughout the clearing and burning period. Field experiments with acetylene as an inhibitor show that immediately following burning, chemical denitrification of nitrite deposited in ash supports a large peak in NO fluxes.

AB Third year growth data from a species screening trial established by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) at the La Selva Biological Station in Puerto Viejo, Heredia, Sarapiqui, Costa Pica from 1987 to 1990 serve as the basis for analysis, Both exotic and native timber species were tested for survival, growth, and form.
   The species x site sum of squares was partitioned in order to identify high yielding species that are generalists and high yielding species that may be specialists. The contribution of each species to the species x site interaction term was determined: four species were found to contribute 61% of the interaction (Ochroma pyramidale, 26.5%; Gmelina arborea, 13.1%; Terminalia superba, 11.2%; and Acacia mangium, 10.3%). If three additional species are added (Pseudobombax septenatum, 9.4%; Terminalia amazonia, 8.7%; and Terminalia ivorensis, 7.4%) 86% of the species x site interaction effect is explained, If each species contributed equally to the variance, each would have an ecovalence of 4.55%.
   Three stable species with above average tree volume (Vochysia guatemalensis, Jacaranda copaia, and Goethalsia meiantha) show potential for reforestation over large regions where plantation maintenance is minimal. The identification of several high yielding unstable exotic species helps to explain their uneven success in plantations in Costa Pica. Some lower yielding, but more stable, native species may offer greater yields where site conditions are poor and maintenance limited.

AB I conducted a 15-month ecological study of habitat preferences and activity and foraging patterns of two troops of mantled howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata, in a lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Reserve in northeastern Costa Rica. The two troops specialized on different habitats in spire of the fact that both of them had all habitats available and were not constrained by neighboring troops since the population density of howlers is low (7-15 howlers/km(2)). Troop 1 spent the majority of time in primary forest (80%) followed by secondary forest (10%), while troop 2 spent the majority of time in undisturbed riparian habitat (60%) followed by primary forest (30%). Habitat sampling indicates that neither the total number of stems, species, or families nor the diversity (Shannon index) or evenness is a good indicator for howler habitat selection. Instead the density of trees from the 12 species most commonly consumed by each troop is the most important factor. Activity and foraging patterns were not dependent upon the season as has been described for howling monkeys in forests with a more pronounced dry season at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and La Pacifica in northwestern Costa Rica. This is likely a result of the more constant food supply at La Selva, combined with less intraspecific competition due to the low howler density. The intraspecific variability of foraging patterns and troop-specific habitat specialization observed in Alouatta palliata should be considered in the conservation biology of primates. Primate relocation programs should include not only an ecological assessment of the release site but also a comparison of the release site with the habitat that the groups currently occupy.

AB Patterns of seed rain were observed at five forest locations in recent treefall gaps and paired understory sites in a tropical wet forest in northeast Costa Rica. Seed rain was dominated by animal-dispersed species. Overall, significantly more wind-dispersed seeds arrived into treefall gaps than into forest understory. Contrary to expectations, understory sires received a greater seed rain than did gap sites during three of four sample periods over the course of one year. Considerable spatial heterogeneity, however, existed among forest locations, with some forest sites receiving up to three times more seed rain input than ochers. Results from this seed rain study generally marched those from an earlier study at this sire in terms of seed rain volume and dominant plane families. Composition of seed rain was more similar among habitat types (i.e., gap, understory) than among forest locations (i.e., paired sites) suggesting that spatial foraging activity and habitat preference of seed dispersers result in non-random patterns of seed rain. If true, then such patterns have implications for evolution of fruit and seed characters that promote survival and establishment of seeds under certain environmental conditions.

AB We characterized stand structure and floristic composition of woody life forms in three, 16-18 yr old secondary stands that regenerated after pasture abandonment, and three nearby old-growth stands of tropical rain forest in lowland Costa Rica. Basal area and stem density for each of four plant size classes (seedlings, saplings, treelets, trees) were similar among stand types, but density of adult canopy palms (individuals greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH), was lower in the secondary stands. We estimate that 15% of the basal area of stems greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH correspond to remnant trees in our secondary stands. The observed rapid woody regrowth compared to other published studies in the lowland neotropics, can be attributed to moderate land use and possibly, to the influence of nutrient-rich volcanic soils in the study area. Overall, plant species richness was lower in the secondary stands, but this difference was less pronounced in the smallest size classes (seedlings, saplings). Median percent similarity of all pairwise stand comparisons showed that floristic composition of saplings (stems greater than or equal to 1 m tall and greater than or equal to 5 cm DBH) was more similar between secondary and old-growth stands than for trees (stems greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH). Because the potential value of secondary forests in conserving woody plant diversity appears highest for the young size classes, we suggest that further studies on floristic composition, especially those addressing the dynamics of the understory component, are needed to refine our understanding of the role of this natural resource in the maintenance of plant biodiversity in disturbed landscapes.

AB Regeneration under tropical plantations has been suggested as a route to facilitate the restoration of natural forests on degraded deforested lands in the tropics. We tested the hypothesis that 7-year-old tree plantations would have greater abundance and species richness of woody colonizers compared to abandoned pastures, but that the response may differ among plantation tree species. Species accumulation curves were constructed for each of seven plantation trees and abandoned pasture. Vochysia guatemalensis and V. ferruginea had higher rates of woody species accumulation in the understory than the other plantations species or the abandoned pasture. When considered by size class of the regeneration, Pentaclethra macroloba plantations had a higher species richness in the 30-200 cm-tall size class compared to the abandoned pastures, and Pinus tecunumanii and Vochysia guatemalensis had greater species richness of stems >200 cm tall compared to the abandoned pasture. Composition of the regeneration was dominated by shrubs, particularly Conostegia subcrustulata. Nevertheless, the Vochysia spp. seemed to favor the presence of a greater diversity of tree species in their understory than the other plantation species. The facilitation of understory development and tree recruitment into the Vochysia plantations may be attributed to suppression of grasses and ferns together with a growth form that attracts seed dispersers. Thus with some plantation species there seems to be a true potential to facilitate a more rapid restoration of a forest community than would occur naturally. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Reforestation of degraded pastures in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica since 1988 has created a patchwork of small plantations that may have the potential to capture and conserve the remnant biodiversity in this largely deforested landscape. Studies of woody regeneration in 6 year old experimental plantations and on-farm plantations on abandoned pasture were conducted at the La Selva Biological Station and surrounding region. The experimental plantations include seven native and four exotic tree species, together with an abandoned pasture control. The impact of plantations on woody regeneration varied according to the plantation tree species. Some species fostered greater abundance of woody regeneration, some greater species richness, other species both abundance and richness, while another group had no effect significantly different from abandoned pasture. Abundance of woody regeneration did not appear to be related to canopy cover at the time of sampling, Nevertheless, plantation trees that established rapidly and had high growth rates did in general stimulate higher levels of woody regeneration. A comparison of this study with one conducted in the same plantations Is months later indicates that the effect of some trees promoting greater density of regeneration may decline over time, while differences in species richness may persist or strengthen. Observations in a range of 6 year old plantations on farms showed a wide range of densities of woody regeneration. Part of this variation could be explained by the presence or absence of grazing within the plantation. Abundance and species richness of woody regeneration under plantation stands can be substantial. Nevertheless, the incidence of mature forest species was low and their ability to invade in the future will probably depend on subsequent stand management. It must not be forgotten that the motivation for reforestation is primarily economic; increased biodiversity is a by-product that, if it is to be promoted, will require adaptation of management practices.

AB Vochysia guatemalensis D. Smith is distributed naturally from Mexico to Panama. It is a promising species for commercial reforestation on degraded lands, but little is known about the variation in important wood traits. Trees of this species were sampled in four natural stands to estimate the variation and radial gradients in wood specific gravity, fiber length, vessel density and vessel radial diameter. Increment cores were extracted from each tree at breast height and divided into 1 cm segments from pith to bark. Specific gravity was determined for each segment. The same wood cores were macerated for measuring fiber length, Vessel density and vessel radial diameter were measured for each segment from cross sections. Significant differences were found among sites (P < 0.05) for specific gravity and fiber length, Both of these variables also increased from pith to bark at all sites, and these radial gradients were significantly different among sites (P < 0.05), Vessel density was also significantly different among sites, but there was no significant change from pith to bark. No significant differences were detected among sites for mean vessel radial diameter; however, radial change in vessel diameter was significantly different among sites.

ID REFORESTATION
AB Reforestation of abandoned pastures in the lowland per humid tropics by farmers presents conditions distinct from those for which traditional plantation forestry species have been selected, i.e., low intensity site management, compacted soils and high year-round rainfall. The adaptation of 14 exotic (proven plantation species in other tropical regions) and 66 potential native plantation timber species to these conditions was tested in a 6-year-old trial in the lowland humid tropics of Costa Rica. Two exotic species, Gmelina arborea and Acacia mangium, had the highest growth rates, but both were subject to pest attacks that limited the life of the stand. Other exotic species (Pinus spp. and Eucalyptus spp.) did not express the high growth rates typical of these species in other regions. Native species within the top 20 overall species tended to have higher survival, fewer pests, but lower growth rates than exotics of similar wood qualities. Of the natives tested, only about 10 species had sufficiently high growth rates and good form to be attractive as potential plantation species, these included Vochysia spp., Stryphnodendron excelsum and Terminalia amazonia. Two native species with high growth rates but poor form were Goethalsia meiantha and Sclerolobium guianensis. The native potential plantation species appeared to be well adapted to the low input forestry practiced by farmers in the lowland humid tropics, while the traditional forestry species (exotic to this region) probably require more intensive production systems. If a wide range of production systems is considered, e.g., agroforestry, fuel wood lots, and mixed plantations, the biodiversity of native species provides a resource to potentially fill these different production niches.

AB Using data from 10,726 captures of birds in mist nets, we document the high alpha and beta diversity of the understory avifauna in the Tilaran mountains of north-central Costa Rica. We grouped the capture data from 20 sampling sites into five Holdridge life zones that represent a gradient in elevation and seasonality of precipitation. Despite the limited size of the study area (200 km(2)) and the relatively small differences in elevation (700 to 1,700 m), major differences were found among each of the five life zones. We recorded a total of 235 species, with species richness increasing downslope on both the Pacific and Caribbean sides of the range. Rarefaction curves showed that the elevational zone of 650 to 750 m on the Caribbean side (Wet Premontane Transition Forest) was the most diverse per unit of mist-netting effort and that the Lower Montane Rain Forest on the continental divide (1,500 to 1,700 m) was the least diverse. Adjacent life zones had similarity indices ranging from 0.30 to 0.47; beta diversity for the region was 0.45. These measures are indicative of a high species turnover among our samples as delimited by Holdridge's life zone system, suggesting a concordance between the life zone system and the distribution of the region's diverse understory avifauna. Elevational migrants made up similar proportions of the avifauna in ail five zones, whereas the diversity of long-distance migrants was inversely related to elevation. The distribution of species of conservation concern did not track the pattern of overall diversity. Our results provide several lessons for land managers and present a strong case for the need to preserve large areas with elevational diversity in mountainous regions of the tropics.

AB We investigated the breeding system and interfertility of both subspecies of Asclepias incarnata. We performed hand-pollinations in the glasshouse to compare fruit-set from self- vs, cross-pollinations and to assess interfertility in crosses between the subspecies. We also used horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis to infer mating-system parameters from open-pollinated progeny arrays in three natural populations over two consecutive years. Plants of ssp. incarnata were about 1/6 as likely to mature hand self-pollinated fruits as were ssp, pulchra plants. Furthermore, plants varied significantly in both self- and cross-fertility. Fertile offspring resulted from intersubspecific crosses, but hybrid plants showed reduced pollen fertility relative to parental plants, which is similar to what has been reported for wider hybrid crosses among milkweeds. Reduced pollen fertility in hybrids, along with geographical barriers, may contribute to maintaining subspecific differentiation. Based on allozyme markers, naturally pollinated populations were largely outcrossed (t(m) ranged from 0.881 to 0.986). Plants varied significantly with respect to outcrossed male fertility (r(p) ranged from 0.186 to 0.396) but not self-fertility (r(t) was not significantly different from 0). Outcrossing rate did not differ significantly among populations or between years. We found swamp milkweed to be neither fully self-compatible nor self-incompatible, which adds to growing evidence of the complexity of milkweed breeding systems. Variation in frequencies of alleles modifying the expression of the self-incompatibility system could explain some of this complexity.

AB To evaluate how environmental and genetic factors influence mating-system evolution, accurate estimates of outcrossing rates of individual plants (families) are required. Using isozyme markers, we observed wide variation in family outcrossing rates in three natural populations of Asclepias incarnata using three statistical methods: (1) a multilocus maximum-likelihood procedure (t(m)); (2) a multilocus method-of-moments procedure (t(a)); and (3) a direct comparison of progeny phenotypes against maternal phenotypes (t(d)). Neighborhood floral-display size was positively correlated with t(a) in one population, but showed no relationship with any of the other estimates of outcrossing for any population. Monte-Carlo simulations revealed that statistical variation associated with these estimation procedures can be large enough to explain all of the observed variation in outcrossing. We also found that significant, spurious correlations with neighborhood floral display could arise, on average, 7% of the time by chance alone. Our observations suggest that it is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of outcrossing in naturally pollinated plants using the estimation procedures currently available. Moreover, we caution that attempts to interpret observed variation in family outcrossing estimates by observing variation in ecological parameters could be misleading.

AB Field observations revealed that females of the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), defended oviposition sites on mangos (Mangifera indica L.) against conspecific females. In most encounters, females simply lunged at opponents and chased them off the fruit without physical contact. However, head-butting and pushing were observed in about 10% of the contests. Body size was a key determinant of fighting success, with larger females winning 85% of the encounters. In a field experiment, arrivals, oviposition, and aggression of females were compared between intact vs. sliced peaches. Similar numbers of females landed on the two classes of fruits, but a greater proportion of alighting females oviposited on sliced peaches than intact peaches. The adaptive function of female territoriality is discussed in light of these findings.

AB We examined the activity pattern of seven ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae; Brachymyrmex sp., Camponotus atriceps, Camponotus integellus, Camponotus sp., Crematogaster nigropilosa, Pheidole biconstricta, and Pheidole sp.) and one wasp species (Hymenoptera: Vespidae; Parachartergus apicalis) tending two treehopper species (Homoptera: Membracidae; Antianthes sp, and Cerosa sp.) on Acnistus arborescens trees (Solanales: Solanaceae) at San Luis Biological Station in Costa Rica. We observed hymenopteran attendants at 61 of 67 treehopper aggregations. All eight hymenopteran species tended tree-hoppers during the day, but only three of the ant species (C. atriceps, C. nigropilosa, and P. biconstricta) also tended at night. Whereas 23 treehopper aggregations had the same species of ant tending during both day and night, 19 aggregations had two different attendant species, one diurnal and one nocturnal. In all 19 cases, the nocturnal tender was Camponotus atriceps, a large carpenter ant. Several earlier studies have reported a diel shift in species tending homopterans. In all cases, the nocturnal tender was a species of Camponotus. A possible cause for this diel shift relates to the relatively large body size of Camponotus workers, which may allow them to displace smaller ants at night, but may be a disadvantage during the day because it makes Camponotus workers a preferred target for diurnal parasites and predators.

AB Flower selection and pollen-collecting effort were monitored for 3 species of bees that sonicate flowers of Solanum wendlandii Hook. for pollen in southern Costa Rica. Between 0700-0900 hours, Bombus pullatus (Fkln.), Euglossa erythrochlora Moure, and Pseudaugochloropsis graminea (Fabricius) foraged more frequently at new flowers (that had opened the day of observation) than old ones (that had opened at least 1 day before observation). Between 0900-1100 hours, however, this preference was no longer evident, and all 3 species visited new and old flowers with similar frequency. E. erythrochlora and P. graminea spent more time harvesting pollen during 1) initial (first or second) visits to new flowers than initial visits to old flowers and 2) initial visits to new flowers than final (seventh or later) visits to new flowers. Similar, although not statistically significant, trends were evident for B. pullatus as well. An experiment using pollinator exclusion bags revealed that the reduced foraging effort at individual flowers was resource-dependent and was not simply a time-dependent phenomenon.

TI Canopy height models and airborne lasers to estimate forest biomass: two
   problems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID AREA
AB Three ground datasets were used to simulate the canopy height characteristics of tropical forests in Costa Rica for the purposes of forest biomass estimation. The canopy height models (CHMs) were used in conjunction with airborne laser data. Gross biomass estimation errors on the order of 50-90% arose in two of the three analyses. The characteristics of the datasets and the biomass estimation procedure are reviewed to identify sources of error. In one dataset, the width of the fixed-area ground plots were small enough (5m) that significant portions of the overstory canopy above the plots were not accounted for in the ground samples. The use of mapped stand data from thin ground plots resulted in inaccurate CHMs, which in turn lead to gross overestimates of forest biomass (about 90% larger than the ground reference value). CHMs generated using mensuration data collected on thin, fixed-area plots may significantly underestimate the average canopy height and crown closure actually found on that plot. This underestimation problem is directly related to plot width. Below a critical threshold, the thinner the plot, the greater the underestimation bias. In the second dataset, it is believed that lower-than-normal rainfalls at the beginning and end of the wet season may have produced a forest canopy with reduced leaf area. The airborne laser pulses penetrated further into the canopy, resulting in airborne laser estimates of forest biomass which grossly underestimated reference values by about 50%. Changing canopy conditions (e.g. leaf loss due to drought, insect defoliation, storm damage) can affect the accuracy of a CHM. Sources of error are reported in order to forewarn those researchers who produce and utilize canopy height models.

ID RADIATION; COVER
AB This study presents the results of a comparison of digital and film hemispherical photography as means of characterizing forest light environments and canopy openness. We also compared hemispherical photography to spherical densiometry. Our results showed that differences in digital image quality due to the loss of resolution that occurred when images were processed for computer analysis did not affect estimates of unweighted openness. Weighted openness and total site factor estimates were significantly higher in digital images compared with film photos. The differences between the two techniques might be a result of underexposure of the film images or differences in lens optical quality and field of view. We found densiometer measurements significantly increased in consistency with user practice and were correlated with total site factor and weighted-openness estimates derived from hemispherical photography. Digital photography was effective and more convenient and inexpensive than film cameras, but until the differences we observed are better explained, we recommend caution when comparisons are made between the two techniques. We also concluded that spherical densiometers effectively characterize forest light environments.

AB Seedlings of three economically important and ecologically different native hardwoods, Cordia alliodora (Boraginaceae), Hyeronima alchorneoides (Euphorbiaceae), and Calophyllum brasiliense (Clusiaceae), were grown in Rootrainers (R) (a book-type container), paper pots, and plastic bags filled with either soil, soil with fertilizer, or compost substrates. After transplanting in the field, treatments with and without fertilizer and herbicide were applied to all nursery stock types. In the nursery, species responded primarily to substrate type. Cordia grew better in bags of soil with NPK fertilizer and compost than in unamended soil, probably responding to higher nitrogen availability. Despite large treatment differences at planting, there were no significant differences in plant size after one year in the field between book containers and bags. The exception were stump plants that were shorter and had higher mortality. Hyeronima grew better in compost than in soil with or without fertilizer, probably responding to higher phosphorus availability and lower bulk density of the compost. Plants produced in compost were also bigger after one year's field growth. Plants produced with soil or in paper pots had higher mortality. Calophyllum grew less in compost compared to soil and grew better when micronutrients were added to the compost and soil. In the field, seedling produced in soil or with micronutrients had higher survival or growth, respectively. In general, species grew better with herbicide and fertilizer application after transplanting. However, there were no interactions with nursery treatments. Responses to field treatments were independent and thus additive to the nursery treatments. Differences in species response can be related to biomass allocation patterns and ecology of the species.

AB Clonal reproduction is a common feature in tropical herbaceous plants and has been shown to be important for recruitment and population maintenance. Although numerous phenological responses (i.e., leaf flushing, flowering, and fruit maturation) have been shown to be associated with seasonality in the tropics, little is known about die relationship between seasonality and levels of clonal reproduction. I examined the temporal and spatial variation in clonal reproduction and its potential trade-off with growth and survival fur a tropical understory herb, Aechmea magdalenae (Andre) Andre ex Baker, Handb. Bromel (Bromeliaceae). I addressed the following questions: (1) how do vegetative growth, survival, and clonal reproduction (i.e., rhizome and ramet production) vary between seasons and between years?; (2) how do these factors differ among populations?; and (3) do simulated dry and wet season light levels cause similar variation in rosette survival and vegetative and clonal reproduction, as found in natural populations? Rhizome and ramet production in A. magdalenae was found to be highly influenced by seasonality During the transition from dry to wet season, there was a significant decrease in survival and a significant increase in clonal reproduction, and rosettes tended to grow at a slower rare. Rosettes in the location with the longest dry season had significantly lower survival, higher clonal reproduction, and a slower growth rate. Clonal reproduction also scarred at smaller rosette sizes in the most seasonal forest. When light levels were manipulated rhizome and ramet production were significantly greater under thr high light conditions, and rosette growth (change in longest leaf length) was significantly lower. Results from this study suggest that A. magdalenae responds to higher light levels by shifting investment from vegetative growth to clonal reproduction. Possible implications of this response to light fur population demography are discussed.

Spores were sown in Thompson medium with agar (25 Petri dishes) and germinated after seven days; the germination pattern was Gleichenia-type and the prothallial development Drynaria-type. Gametangia were typical of homosporous leptosporangiate ferns. Sporophytes appeared after seven months of culture. The sexual phase of this species shares many morphological characteristics with Old and New world species of Polypodiaceae. There is a tendency for vegetative propagation with Pseudocolysis gametophytes.

AB Although dramatic amphibian population declines have been reported worldwide, our understanding of the extent of the declines in Latin America, where amphibian diversity is high, is limited to a few well-documented studies. To better understand the geographic extent of declines, their possible causes, and the measures needed to improve Latin American scientists' ability to research the phenomenon and make effective management recommendations, we convened three regional workshops with 88 Latin American herpetologists and conservationists. Population declines are widespread in Latin America. At least 13 countries have experienced declines, and in 40 cases species are now thought to be extinct or extirpated in a country where they once occurred. Declines or extinctions have affected 30 genera and nine families of amphibians. Most declines have occurred in remote highlands, above 500 m in elevation in Central America and above 1000 m In the Andes. Most documented declines occurred in the 1980s. Of the possible causes studied to date, climate change appears to be important at one site and chytrid fungal disease has been identified at sites in three countries. Although many monitoring studies are currently underway in a variety of habitats, most studies are recent and of short duration. In a signed resolution, workshop participants called for greater collaboration and communication among scientists working in Latin America to understand the geographic extent of population declines and the distribution of possible causal factors. In situ conservation is important to protect habitats, but captive-rearing programs for species subject to imminent extinction are also needed. Better understanding of the taxonomy and natural history of amphibians and more funding for research and monitoring are critical to developing a scientific basis for management action to arrest and reverse population declines.

AB Establishment of Laguncularia racemosa, Avicennia germinans, and A. bicolor was measured along intertidal gradients (mud bank (MB), lower intertidal (LI), and upper intertidal (UI)) on point bars and islands in a Costa Rican tropical estuary. Successful establishment showed the following order - Laguncularia: LI (73%) > MB (52%) > UI (18%), with UI significantly lower than Ll and MB; Avicennia spp.: LI (66%) > UI (51%) > MB (29%), with LI significantly higher than MB. Establishment of Laguncularia in UI was significantly lower than Avicennia spp. due to selective crab herbivory. After 25 days, 52% of Laguncularia propagules were eaten compared to 5% for Avicennia spp. Total mortality of Laguncularia propagules and seedlings was significantly higher than that of Avicennia spp. in all three zones.
   The hydrological regime affected propagule establishment under controlled mesocosin conditions. Four hydrological treatments included flooded according to tidal cycle (FT), no flooding (NF), continuous flooding (F), and flooded according to tidal cycle with propagules additionally buried (FTB). Laguncularia establishment under NF (93%) and F (84%) was significantly greater than under Fr (63%). A. germinans establishment under NF (97%) was greater than under FT (69%). Laguncularia showed significantly higher establishment than A. germinans under F conditions. Laguncularia propagules sank soon after their radicles protruded (5-8 days), and subsequently established under water. A. germinans propagules floated during the 25-day experiment and never established. Propagule establishment under FTB was greater for Laguncularia than for Avicennia (11 and 1%, respectively). Height increase of established Laguncularia seedlings was significantly different among treatments: FT (5.2 turn per day) > NF (3.4 nun per day) > F (2.4 mm per day). Growth of established A. germinans seedlings did not differ between FT (4.8 mm per day) and NF (5.0 mm per day), but it was significantly higher than Laguncularia under NF.
   These results show that both genera can successfully establish on the lower intertidal zone when artificially retained. However, propagule, buoyancy, availability, dispersal, and the effect of water movement on propagule anchoring limit Avicennia spp. establishment in this regularly flooded environment. In the upper intertidal zone, however, differential predation on Laguncularia propagules favors Avicennia spp. establishment and dominance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Variation in post-dispersal seed predation between mature forest and fallow swidden agriculture sites (young forest) was examined for 26 tree and liana species in Peruvian lowland tropical forest. Exclosures were also used to determine the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators. Although species differed significantly in levels of predation, predation of seeds exposed to vertebrates was high (>75%) for all species, while seed predation by invertebrates was lower and more variable. Seed and seedling predation by insects was significantly higher in mature forest, while seed predation by rodents was higher in fallow areas. Other sources of mortality (primarily desiccation) were higher for seeds in fallow areas. The percentage of seeds moved was significantly different among species bur not between forests.

AB Information on bites by snakes of the family Colubridae in Mexico and Central America is reviewed. Little is known of the biochemistry and pharmacology of the Duvernoy gland secretion (venom) of colubrids from this region, although some reports describe proteolytic, phosphodiesterase, phospholipase A(2) and hemorrhagic activities. A search of published reports and an effort to obtain reliable unpublished information on colubrid snake bites in the region documented cases inflicted by species of the genera Conophis, Coniophanes, Crisantophis, Etythrolamprus, Pliocercus, Oxybelis and Dqadophis (=Mastigodryas). The following general pattern emerges from the analysis of these cases: 1) Bites occurred mainly in hands and ringers on people that frequently manipulate colubrids, i.e. herpetologists, herpetoculturists and people that take care of these snakes at museums, exhibits or zoos; and 2) In most cases, only mild local effects were described, i.e. pain, swelling and, in few cases, ecchymosis. In only one case by Erythrolamprus bizonus there was ecchymosis beyond the bitten region, whereas persistent bleeding at the bite site was reported in a Conophis lineatus case. No systemic alterations were described in any of the cases. Management of colubrid bites in Mexico and Central America includes cleaning and disinfection of the bitten area, together with administration of tetanus toxoid. In the case of local infection, antibiotics are administered. There is no experimental or clinical evidence supporting the use of Crotalinae antivenoms in these bites. Despite the lack of systemic alterations in the cases described, caution should be exercised when manipulating these snakes, and bitten people should be closely observed for the potential development of bleeding and coagulopathies, since these effects have been described in bites by colubrid snakes from other regions of the world.

AB A hybrid zone exists between Macaca tonkeana and Macaca hecki (Primates: Cercopithecidae), centered along the Tawaeli-Toboli road in the narrow isthmus that connects North and Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The current study demonstrates morphological substructure from north to south across the hybrid zone. Macaques to the northwest of the Tawaeli-Toboli road more closely resemble M. hecki, and macaques to the southeast of the road resemble M. tonkeana. While morphology shifted for both males and females over a distance of 1,500-2,000 m, adult males were significantly more M. tonkeana-like across the morphological gradient. This suggests that in the study area, males of M. tonkeana-like morphology are dispersing into hybrid groups at the expense of M. hecki-like males. A permutation analysis of diagnostic character states indicated that associations existed among several morphological traits. This could be due to the operation of one or several nonexclusive evolutionary processes, including recent secondary contact, pleiotropic effects, physical linkage of loci, natural selection against hybrids, the influx of parental types, or assortative mating. Continued environmental perturbation associated with the Tawaeli-Toboli road is likely to be a significant factor in the future of the M. tonkeana/M. hecki hybrid interaction.

AB Accurate estimates of the total biomass in terrestrial vegetation are important I-or carbon dynamics Studies at a variety of scales. Although aboveground biomass is difficult to quantify over large areas using traditional techniques, lidar remote sensing holds great promise for biomass estimation because it directly measures components of canopy Structure such as canopy height and the vertical distribution of intercepted canopy surfaces. In this study, our primary goal was to explore the sensitivity of lidar to differences in canopy structure and aboveground biomass in a dense, neotropical rainforest. We first examined the relationship between simple vertical canopy profiles derived from field measurements and the estimated aboveground biomass (EAGB) across a range of field plots located in primary and secondary tropical rainforest and in agroforesty areas. We found that metrics from field-derived vertical canopy profiles arc highly Correlated (R-2 up to .94) with EAGB across the entire range of conditions sampled. Next, we found that vertical canopy profiles from a large-footprint lidar instrument were closely related with coincident field profiles, and that metrics from both field and lidar profiles are highly correlated. As a result. metrics from lidar profiles are also highly correlated (R-2 up to .94) with EAGB across this neotropical landscape. These results help to explain the nature of the relationship between lidar data and EAGB, and also lay the foundation to explore the generality of the relationship between vertical canopy profiles and biomass in other tropical regions.

AB To evaluate the conservation value of forest habitats associated with banana (Musa sp.) plantations, an inventory of bird species was conducted in 10 forest fragments and reforestation areas surrounding seven plantations in the Costa Rican Atlantic lowlands. Birds were censused by point counts at 42 points in conserved forest remnants and 30 points in reforestation areas. To gather information about reproductive patterns, a supplementary mist-net study was conducted at 29 of these sites. Overall, 194 species (11,361 individuals) were recorded in the point counts and 73 species (1035 individuals) in the mist-net study for a combined total of 206 species, including 46 migrants and 87 resident species classified as moderately to highly susceptible to habitat disturbance. Immature birds were observed in 67% of the species captured in the mist-net survey and represented 35% of the total individuals netted. The results suggest that small-scale forest patches associated with banana plantations may provide viable habitat for the conservation of migrants and bird species moderately susceptible to habitat alteration.

AB The spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) is believed to have been a primary herpetological invader of eastern North America following the most recent period of glacial retreat. We examined the phylogeographic pattern and population structure of P. crucifer to determine whether the distribution of haplotypic variants reflect post-Pleistocene recolonization dynamics. A number of geographically isolated evolutionary lineages were supported by both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses, and by coalescence approaches applied to mtDNA. South-western Ontario represents a high level of genotypic diversity (pi) due to the presence of two divergent lineages. The geographic distribution of these lineages are interpreted as reflecting post-glacial recolonization dynamics from separate, isolated refugia during the late Pleistocene that have come into secondary contact in SW Ontario. The phylogenetic placement of haplotypes from the range of P. crucifer bartramiana (Florida and South Carolina) does not allow for monophyly of P. crucifer crucifer, and therefore the bartramiana subspecies designation does not reflect a separate evolutionary lineage.

AB To evaluate the impact of pesticides used in banana cultivation on beneficial invertebrates, parasitic Hymenoptera were inventoried in six plantations that received conventional applications of herbicides, nematicides, fungicides and insecticides and in two plantations under low-input treatments. To put banana into perspective relative to other monocultures, parasitic Hymenoptera were compared with those found in four other crops: citrus, heart of palm, macadamia and Gmelina arborea. Over 7800 female parasitoids were collected in the inventory. Parasitoid abundance and species richness were greatest in low-input banana, intermediate in the four other monocultures and lowest in conventional banana. Parasitoid abundance and species richness were inversely related to rates of nematicide and insecticide application. Banana plantations had a characteristic parasitoid fauna distinct from the other crops, but there was no distinct parasitoid community associated with low-input vs. conventional banana. Differences in parasitoid richness among farms were not related to: (1) abundance of parasitoids at each site, (2) plantation size or age, and (3) parasitoid host affinities. These results are discussed in the context of historical lepidopteran outbreaks in banana associated with pesticide induced upsets of natural enemy control, and recommendations are offered about how pest management might be altered to minimize impacts on hymenopteran parasitoids.

AB Studies over the last few decades have suggested that neotropical vertebrate taxa may have greater genetic disparity than their nearctic counterparts. Here, a robust test of this suggestion using bootstrap resampling of allozyme data for 53 passerine (16 nearctic and 37 neotropical) species confirms the pattern. This disparity could be due to taxonomic artifacts or to differences in the rate or history of genetic processes between regions. In contrast, a selection-based explanation emphasizes negative feedback of species richness on rates of phenotypic, but not molecular, evolution in neotropical species.

ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB Agroforestry options as a means of promoting reforestation were tested by establishing with 10 farmers simple comparisons between pure plantations and timber trees with annual or perennial intercrops. Two year-old intercropped trees on-farm had 22-48% greater height and 24-38% greater diameter than trees in pure plantations. The exception was Cordia alliodora that did not respond significantly to intercropping with cassava (Manihot esculenta). Only intercrops with the most valuable crops on agricultural soils produced a return to labour above the daily wage rate. On non-agricultural soils, farmers only intercrop a small area of their plantations with subsistence crops to meet home consumption needs. In the context of Costa Rica intercropping appeared to have a limited potential to finance the reforestation costs of farmers.

TI Snakebite envenomation in Costa Rica: a revision of incidence in the

DT Article
DE snakebite; envenomation; epidemiology; Costa Rica
AB We reviewed snakebite records from the Costa Rican health system from the year 1990-2000. During this decade, a total of 5550 snakebite cases occurred in the country. While the average number of snakebites per year was relatively constant at 504 cases, the annual incidence per 100,000 people decreased. This reduction is mainly due to high population growth in Costa Rica, which increased 35% during the study period. The most affected population lives in rural areas characterized by high precipitation, and mainly includes young agricultural workers. The lancehead Bothrops asper is considered the most important species affecting humans. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID P-MANICULATUS
AB Field identification of the White-footed Mouse (Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis) and Long-tailed Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis) is difficult because of their similar external morphology. Peromyscus were sampled by live-trapping during a five-year period (1992-1996) at the Arnot Teaching and Research Forest, Van Etten, New York and identified to species by electrophoresis of their salivary amylase. No electromorphs were shared between P. leucopus and P. maniculatus, thus permitting unambiguous species identification of individuals. Means and ranges of four external measurements (car, head-body, hind-foot, and tail) and tail to head-body ratio were determined for amylase-genotyped live mice. Although some body measurements did differ on average between the two species (ear, head-body, and tail for adults; hind-foot and tail for juveniles), the ranges of these overlap considerably. When the four external measurements (excluding the tail to head-body ratio) were used to construct two discriminant-function equations, they yielded correct identification of 80% of the adult P.l. noveboracensis and P.m. gracilis assessed excluding juveniles, and 71% of adult and juvenile mice combined. The function reported here allows partial field identification, but genetic analysis remains the only reliable field method for differentiation between live P.l. noveboracensis and P.m. gracilis.

AB 1. Until very recently there have been no digital data from satellites for studying events that occur at scales of 10-1000 m(2) over large areas (100-100 000 ha). Many phenomena of interest to ecologists, such as impacts of selective logging on forest processes, occur over large extents but at local scales. Here we report results from a pilot project to evaluate through visual interpretation the potential of newly available 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multi-spectral data from the IKONOS satellite, for studying forest structure, dynamics and logging impacts in logged and old-growth tropical moist forest.
   2. The study area, the Mil Madeireira Itacoatiara Ltda site of Precious Woods Amazon, near Itacoatiara, Amazonas, Brazil, is managed using reduced-impact logging practices to minimize environmental impacts, and thus represents a lower bound for logging impacts in tropical rain forests.
   3. The IKONOS image was georeferenced using uncorrected global positioning system (GPS) locations for 10 control trees whose crowns were clearly visible in the image. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the geometric transformation was 4 m, while the mean crown diameter of 50 randomly chosen trees in old-growth forest was 9.4 m. The fact that the RMSE was less than half the average crown diameter implies that it will usually be possible to locate from the ground crowns that are distinct on the image, given sufficiently accurate GPS locations.
   4. IKONOS data are well suited for evaluating and monitoring logging impacts. Many impacts of logging were clearly observable in the image, including major and some minor roads, logging patios and larger logging gaps. Smaller extraction roads and logging gaps were not observable.
   5. Many individual trees were distinct on the IKONOS image, indicating that it is now feasible to conduct demographic studies of tropical rain forest canopy trees based on repeated satellite observations. Linking these remotely sensed data to ground data will require improved GPS positions, because it is currently difficult to obtain accurate GPS readings in tropical rain forest understoreys.
   6. Synthesis and applications. IKONOS 1-m and 4-m data were found to be useful for identifying individual trees as well as some logging management features in a tropical moist forest in central Amazonia. These data will have many applications for research and management of intervened and old-growth tropical forests, including planning and assessment of logging activities, as well as monitoring adherence to certification criteria such as those of the Forest Stewardship Council. Rapid development of these applications will come from building on existing data on forest structure and function, and by fostering collaborations between remote sensing scientists, ecologists and natural resource managers.

AB Banana plantations are treated with herbicides, nematocides, fungicides, and insecticides to control weeds, nematodes, fungal pathogens, and insect pests. The impact of these pesticides on the organisms within plantations, however, is largely unknown. Because they are integral to terrestrial ecosystems, ants have been widely used as biological indicators in invertebrate biodiversity assessments and studies of habitat rehabilitation. Hence, to evaluate the effects of pesticides on banana plantation invertebrates, ants were surveyed in six conventional plantations treated with the pesticides described above and in two low-input plantations that received reduced applications of herbicides, nematocides, and insecticides. To put banana into perspective relative to other tropical monocultures, ants in banana were also compared with those in four other crops: citrus (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck), heart of palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth), macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia Maiden and Betche), and Gmelina arborea (L.) Roxb. A total of 23,364 ants comprising 107 species, 48 genera, and 6 subfamilies was collected at the 12 study sites. Species richness was highest in the other crops, being lower in both low-input and conventional banana, which did not differ significantly. Ant species richness correlated with the richness of parasitoids, collected concurrently from the same sites, but differences among low-input banana, conventional banana, and the other four monocultures were more pronounced for parasitoids. Species richness in conventional banana, low input banana, and the four other crops was independent of species origin (native or exotic), habitat preference, nest type, diet, or ant functional groups sensu Andersen.

It is most similar to R nasutum and is characterized by a pattern of bands, persistence of the juvenile tail color in adults, and a high number of dorsal scales. Analysis of mtDNA sequences confirms its distinction from P. nasutum. The existence of this species reinforces the notion of elevated herpetofaunal endemism in southwestern Costa Rica.

AB We describe an ontogenetic shift in nitrogen (N) isotopic values in two rosette-forming epiphytic bromeliads. Leaf tissue N isotope values of small individuals of two bromeliad species (mean -6.2parts per thousand) differed from those of large individuals within each species (mean -0.5parts per thousand). Using references for potential N sources, we calculated the relative contribution of autochthonous (soil-derived through leaf litter) and allochthonous (atmospheric deposition) N with a two-member mixing model. Atmospheric sources contributed as much as 77-80% of the N in small individuals, whereas soil-derived N contributed 64-72% (conservative reference value) to 100% (less conservative reference value) of leaf tissue N in large plants. Shifts in N source with increasing plant size may be important aspects of rainforest complexity, an understudied aspect of ecosystem diversity.

AB Assessment of forest responses to climate change is severely hampered by the limited information on tree death on short temporal and broad spatial scales, particularly in tropical forests. We used 1-m resolution panchromatic IKONOS and 0.7-m resolution QuickBird satellite data, acquired in 2000 and 2002, respectively, to evaluate tree death rates at the La Selva Biological Station in old-growth Tropical Wet Forest in Costa Rica, Central America. Using a calibration factor derived from ground inspection of tree deaths predicted from the images, we calculated a landscape-scale annual exponential death rate of 2.8%. This corresponds closely to data for all canopy-level trees in 18 forest inventory plots, each of 0.5 ha, for a mostly-overlapping 2-year period (2.8% per year). This study shows that high-spatial-resolution satellite data can now be used to measure old-growth tropical rain forest tree death rates, suggesting many new avenues for tropical forest ecology and global change research.

AB Understanding the current status of the world's tropical rain forests (TRF) can be greatly advanced by global coverage of remotely sensed data at the scale of individual tree crowns. In 1999 the IKONOS satellite began offering worldwide 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral data. Here we show that these data can be used to address diverse aspects of forest ecology and land-use classification in the tropics.
   Using crowns of emergent trees as control points, we georeferenced a 600-ha subset of IKONOS 1-m and 4-m data from an August 2000 image of the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (root mean square error = 4.3 m). Crown area measured on the image was highly correlated with crown area for the same tree measured from the ground. Using a 1988 aerial photograph as a baseline, all trees >1 m diameter in a long-term study that died over the ensuing 12-year period, and that could be located in the photograph, were detected as missing in the IKONOS image (N = 7). Crown growth for large trees visible on both images averaged 12 m(2)/yr (N = 16). We thus demonstrate that IKONOS imagery can provide data on four variables necessary for doing demographic research: tree size, location, mortality, and growth.
   Stand basal area, estimated aboveground biomass, and percentage of the canopy >15 m tall for 18 0.5-ha permanent forest inventory plots in old growth were all highly significantly correlated with different indices derived from the IKONOS data.
   We used summary statistics from the original IKONOS data as well as derived indices to characterize nine areas with well-documented land-use histories. Secondary forests were clearly separable from the other sites. One of the secondary forests was 40 years old, suggesting that IKONOS data can be used to detect significantly older secondary forest than is possible with coarser resolution satellite data. The selectively logged forest was distinguishable by measuring the size of the largest crowns on the 1-m image. This suggests a range of applications for detecting and quantifying biomass degradation due to selective logging and edge effects.
   Satellite data at 1-m and 4-m resolution make possible a truly global approach to fine spatial resolution remote-sensing studies of TRF ecology and land use.

AB Plants can significantly affect ecosystem water balance by hydraulic redistribution (HR) from dry to wet soil layers via roots (also called hydraulic lift, HL, when the redistribution is from deep to shallow soil). However, the information on how co-occurring species in natural habitats differ in HL ability is insufficient. In a field study, we compared HL ability of four tree species (including three congeneric oak species) and two C4 bunch grass species that co-occur in subxeric habitats of fall-line sandhills in southeastern USA. Soil water potentials (psi(s)) were recorded hourly for 3 years both in large chambers that isolated roots for each species and outside the chambers. Outside of root chambers, soil drying occurred periodically in the top 25 cm and corresponded with lack of precipitation during the summer growing season. Soil moisture was continuously available at a 1 m depth. HL activity was observed in three of the tree species, with greater frequency for Pinus palustris than for Quercus laevis and Q. incana. The fourth tree species Q. margaretta did not exhibit HL activity even though it experienced a similar psi(s) gradient. For the C4 bunch grasses, Aristida stricta exhibited a small amount of HL activity, but Schizachyrium scoparium did not. The capacity for HL activity may be linked to the species ecological distribution. The four species that exhibited HL activity in this subxeric habitat are also dominant in adjacent xeric sandhill habitats, whereas the species that did not exhibit HL are scarcely found in the xeric areas. This is consistent with other studies that found greater fine root survival in dry soil for the four xeric species exhibiting HL activity. The differential ability of these species to redistribute water from the deep soil to the rapidly drying shallow soil likely has a strong effect on the water balance of sandhill plant communities, and is likely linked to their differential distribution across edaphic gradients.

AB Fine root dynamics significantly affect plant performance through soil resource capture, and ecosystem function through soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. The responses of fine roots to natural gradients in resource availability, however, are poorly understood. We assessed fine root dynamics across a soil texture gradient in Pinus palustris Mill.-Aristida stricta Michx. savannas. These savannas are currently the subject of considerable conservation and restoration efforts in the southeastern US. Fine root dynamics were determined for two growing seasons in three soil types with minirhizotrons. The soils were characterized as: shallow, loamy soils; intermediate depth sandy soils; and deep, sandy soils. Although soil moisture was not quantified in this study, increasing drainage capacity and clear shifts to xerophytic vegetation strongly suggest increasing soil moisture limitation from shallow to deep soils. Potential net N mineralization, microbial biomass and annual overstory litterfall were also characterized across the gradient. Consistent with increasing soil moisture limitation, fine root production increased and diameters decreased from shallow to deep sands, as did the amount of deep root production. Litterfall also declined across this gradient. In contrast, fine root turnover rates were highest in the intermediate soils where nitrogen availability was highest. These results suggest that fine root turnover rate may vary independently of annual fine root production and these components may differentially respond to multiple limiting resources.

AB Plants in light-limited tropical rainforest understories face an important carbon allocation trade-off: investment of available carbon into photosynthetic tissue should be advantageous, while risk of damage and mortality from falling debris favors investment into nonphotosynthetic Structural tissue. We examined the modulus of rupture (sigma(max)), Young's Modulus Of elasticity (E), and flexural stiffness (F) of sterns and petioles in 14 monocot species from six families. These biomechanical properties were evaluated with respect to habitat. rates of leaf production. clonality, and growth form. Species with higher E and sigma(max) indicating greater resistance per unit area to bending and breaking, respectively, tended to be shade-tolerant. slow growing, and nonclonal. This result is consistent with in increase in carbon allocation to structural tissue in shade-tolerant species at the expense of photosynthetic tissue and growth. Forest-edge species were weaker per unit area (had a lower E), but had higher flexural stiffness clue to increases in stein and petiole diameter. while this is inefficient in requiring more carbon per unit of structural support, it may enable forest-edge species to support larger and heavier leaves. Our results emphasize the degree to which biomechanical traits vary with ecological niche and illustrate suites of characteristics associated with different carbon allocation strategies.

AB The tropical emergent tree Hyeronima alchorneoides has large decreases in leaf size with tree age: 1200 cm(2) at 1 yr. 900 cm(2) at 3 yr. 200 cm(2) at 11 yr and 80 cm(2) in old (>30 yr) individuals. We tracked leaf growth and physiological attributes on trees of three different ages (1, 3. and 11 yr) to determine the developmental basis and functional consequences of this variation. Leaves on young trees grew faster and sustained maximum rates of leaf expansion longer than leaves on older trees. Leaf mass per area (LMA) did not differ among, age classes. Maximum photosynthetic rates reflected differences in leaf nitrogen concentration, in which leaves front the lower crown of younger trees outperformed those at a comparable crown position in older trees. One-year-old trees had the lowest stomatal conductance and the greatest instantaneous water use efficiency. Ontogenetic plasticity in mature leaf size, structure, and physiology may be a balance between the advantages conferred by rapid height growth when trees are voting and the benefits derived from producing, branches that increase light harvesting ability as trees reach the canopy.

AB Recently, the importance of seed predation by crabs on mangrove species distributions and densities has been established by several studies. In a tropical coastal terrestrial forest in Costa Rica, we investigated the relative importance of predation by land crabs, Gecarcinus quadratus, and hermit crabs, Coenobita compressus, on measured forest composition through a series of seed removal and seedling establishment experiments. We also used natural light-gaps and adjacent non-gap sites to test how canopy cover affects crab predation ( seed removal) and seedling establishment. We found fewer tree species (S = 18) and lower densities ( seedlings, saplings, and adults) in the coastal zone within 100 m of coastline, than in the inland zone (S = 59). Land crab densities were higher in the coastal zone (3.03 +/- 1.44 crabs m(-2)) than in the inland zone (0.76 +/- 0.78 crabs m(-2)), and hermit crabs were not present in the inland zone. Seed removal and seedling mortality also were higher in the coastal zone than in the inland zone, and in the open controls than in the crab exclosures. Mortality of seeds and seedlings was two to six times higher in the controls than exclosures for four of the five experiments. Crabs preferred seeds and younger seedlings over older seedlings but showed no species preferences in the seed (Anacardium excelsum, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Terminalia oblonga) and seedling (Pachira quinata and E. cyclocarpum) stages. We conclude that the observed differences in tree densities were caused by differential crab predation pressure along the coastal gradient, while the differences in species composition were due to predator escape ( satiation) by seed quantity. Canopy cover did not affect seed removal rates, but did affect seedling survival with higher mortality in the non-gap versus gap environments. In summary, crab predation of seeds and seedlings, and secondarily canopy cover, are important factors affecting tree establishment in terrestrial coastal forests.

AB Numerous tree species can establish by vegetative means in the tropics. Many are used in agriculture as living fences and in alley cropping and could also be used in a restorational setting. However, little is known about their establishment ability. This study evaluated the establishment ability and cover development of multiple species in three separate field trials in northern Honduras. First, 11 species were evaluated for their ability to establish in a common garden experiment. Second, of the former species, Bursera simaruba and Gliricidia sepium were evaluated for 2 years for their ability to establish vegetatively and develop cover at three deforested sites. Lastly, a study examined whether greater initial stake height and diameter at breast height increased the establishment success and crown development of G. sepium stakes. First, five species, Erythrina berteroana, Erythrina fusca, Jatropha curcas, G. sepium, and B. simaruba, had high establishment success. Others showed promise but may have been planted in the wrong season. Second, establishment for G. sepium was nearly 100% at all sites, whereas B. simaruba ranged from 30-50%. Gliricidia sepium stakes developed more rapidly and attained greater cover than B. simaruba. Dry season planting may increase the establishment success of both species. Lastly, greater initial stake height and diameter at breast height each resulted in greater crown development for G. sepium. The use of living fence species as a restorational tool has been overlooked. Aside from the advantages of planting tree species vegetatively, species can act as seed recruitment foci by attracting seed dispersers and provide shade to improve microclimatic conditions for seedling establishment. The technique described is simple and could have broad application throughout tropical regions.

AB The development of ecological stoichiometry has centered on organisms and their interactions, with less emphasis on the meaning or value of a comprehensive ecosystem stoichiometry at larger scales. Here we develop a conceptual framework that relates internal processes and exogenous factors in spatially- and temporally-linked ecosystems. This framework emerges from a functional view of ecosystem stoichiometry rooted in understanding the causes and consequences of relative stoichiometric balance, defined as the balance between ratios of resource supply and demand. We begin by modifying a graphical model based on resource ratio competition theory that relates resource supply and demand to ecosystem processes. This approach identified mechanisms, or stoichiometric schemes, through which ecosystems respond to variable resource supply. We expand this view by considering the effects of exogenous factors other then resource supply that comprise a stoichiometric template that influences stoichiometric balance within ecosystems. We then describe a number of examples of patterns in organismal stoichiometry in several types of ecosystems that illustrate stoichiometric schemes and factors that impinge directly on stoichiometric patterns. Next, we conduct an initial analysis of the stoichiometric effects of spatial linkages between ecosystems, and how those relate to boundary dynamics and hot spot development. We conclude by outlining research directions that will significantly advance our understanding of stoichiometric constraints on ecosystem structure and function.

AB Land cover and land use change have long been known to influence the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of streams. This study makes use of land cover maps derived from fine resolution satellite imagery and an extensive stream quality dataset to determine the relationship between small watershed health rankings and land cover composition and configuration. Landscape metrics were derived from digital impervious surface area (ISA), tree cover (percent), and agricultural crop maps within Montgomery County, Maryland. Watershed rankings were developed by state and county collaborators (MD-DNR and MCDEP) using extensive biological and chemical measurements. In stepwise logistic regression models the factors accounting for the most variation in stream health ranking were the percent ISA, followed by the percent of tree cover. Riparian buffer zone tree cover was also a significant predictor. Of the metrics that considered the spatial configuration of the landscape, a contagion index and the percent of ISA in the flow path from the ISA to the stream were also found to be significant predictors of stream health. Despite limited ability to characterize landscape configuration or narrow riparian buffer zone vegetation with coarser resolution imagery (from Landsat), model results were not significantly different from those based on the use of fine-resolution ISA information, suggesting that broader area applications of the approach are possible. The results indicate that management practices designed to improve stream water quality should focus on the amount of ISA and tree cover in both the watershed and within the buffer zone.

AB We investigated the utility of high spectral and spatial resolution imagery for the automated species-level classification of individual tree crowns (ITCs) in a tropical rain forest (TRF). Laboratory spectrometer and airborne reflectance spectra (161 bands, 437-2434 nm) were acquired from seven species of emergent trees. Analyses focused on leaf-, pixel- and crown-scale spectra. We first described the spectral regions and factors that most influence spectral separability among species. Next, spectral-based species classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum likelihood (ML) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classifiers applied to combinations of bands from a stepwise-selection procedure. Optimal regions of the spectrum for species discrimination varied with scale. However, near-infrared (700-1327 nm) bands were consistently important regions across all scales. Bands in the visible region (437-700 nm) and shortwave infrared (1994-2435 nm) were more important at pixel- and crown scales. Overall classification accuracy decreased from leaf scales measured in the laboratory to pixel- and crown scales measured from the airborne sensor. Leaf-scale classification using LDA and 40 bands had 100% overall accuracy. Pixel-scale spectra from sunlit regions of crowns were classified with 88% overall accuracy using a ML classifier and 60 bands. The highest crown-scale (ITC) accuracy was 92% with LDA and 30 bands. Producer's accuracies ranged from 70% to 100% and User's accuracies ranged from 81% to 100%. The SAM classifier performed poorly at all scales and spectral regions of analysis. ITCs were also classified using an object-based approach in which crown species labels were assigned according to the majority class of classified pixels within a crown. An overall accuracy of 86% was achieved with an object-based LDA classifier applied to 30 bands of data. Object-based and crown-scale ITC classifications were significantly more accurate with 10 narrow-bands relative to accuracies achieved with simulated multispectral, broadband data. We concluded that high spectral and spatial resolution imagery acquired over TRF canopy has substantial potential for automated ITC species discrimination. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The establishment and management of tropical plantations has the potential to significantly alter patterns in nitrogen (N) cycling relative to old-growth tropical forests, which are generally characterized by high N availability and large fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas. We used N-15 tracer additions to examine the effects of plantation establishment and management on gross N-cycling rates, N retention via microbial assimilation and dissimilatory nitrate (NO3-) reduction to ammonium (NH4+) (DNRA), and N losses via N2O emissions. In general, plantations had lower rates of N cycling and increased potential for N losses compared to old-growth forests, but there were few differences between very short (one-year) rotation and 10-yr-old uncut plantations. Gross N mineralization declined by almost 50% in the plantations compared to the old-growth forests, and much of the mineralized N was nitrified at all sites. Gross nitrification rates were more variable and did not differ between old-growth forests and unfertilized plantations; however, fertilization increased gross nitrification by a factor of 6 in short-rotation forests, signaling a potential mechanism for increased N losses via leaching and gaseous emissions. Old-growth forests had significantly higher microbial biomass N and NH4+ assimilation rates. No microbial N assimilation was measured in the plantation soils, nor was there evidence of gross NH4+ immobilization from estimates of NH4+ consumption and nitrification. Plantations and old-growth forests had similar DNRA rates (0.23 mu g(.)g(-1.)d(-1)), which retains N in the ecosystem, and plantations had lower N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes from plantations were highly sensitive to reducing conditions, highlighting the potential for high rates of NO losses. Our results show that plantation establishment can decrease rates of N cycling, but once forests are converted to plantations, internal N-cycling pathways and N2O fluxes are relatively resistant to disturbance associated with short rotation length.

We also tested the effect of resident anyphaenid spiders on mirid behavior and levels of folivory. Plants without mirids suffered significantly more folivory than plants with mirids. The impact of spider removal was less clear. Together, these results support the idea that resident mirids serve in anti-herbivore defense for P. urostachyum plants.

AB We examined whether the experimental exclusion of large mammalian and small rodent seed predators had differing effects on seedling recruitment under natural seed rain conditions. In both primary and late-successional secondary forested areas, exclosure experiments using natural seed densities were designed to assess seedling recruitment. To assess the differences in seedling recruitment, we monitored three exclosure treatments (1.2 m radius/1.5 m height) in two forest types (primary vs. late-successional secondary forest): (1) fenced exclosures that excluded large mammals; (2) fenced exclosures that excluded both large and small mammals; and (3) open controls. Within each exclosure treatment, we marked and identified all seedlings at the beginning of the experiment (February 2001), followed the marked seedlings' fate for a year, and then marked and identified all new seedlings after a year. Two preliminary findings were generated from these data: for some tree species, small rodents and large mammals have differential effects on seedling recruitment, and the effect of excluding mammals did not differ with habitat type (primary vs. late-successional secondary forest). These preliminary results highlight the need to examine further how the effects of small rodent and large mammal exclusion may affect species-specific seed predation and seedling recruitment in a variety of habitat/land use types (e.g., primary forest, late-successional forest, and early-successional forest).

AB Background: Multi-character empirical studies are important contributions to our understanding of the process of speciation. The relatively conserved morphology of, and importance of the mate recognition system in anurans, combined with phylogenetic tools, provide an opportunity to address predictions about the relative role of each in the process of speciation. We examine the relationship among patterns of variation in morphology, call characters, and 16S gene sequences across seven populations of a neotropical hylid frog, Hyla leucophyllata, to infer their relative importance in predicting the early stages of population differentiation.
   Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrate that both morphological and call characteristics were significantly variable among populations, characterized by significantly lower intra-population dispersion in call space than morphological space, and significantly greater among-population variation in call structure. We found lack of concordance between a 16S DNA phylogeny of Hyla leucophyllata and the significant population-level differentiation evident in both external morphology and male advertisement call. Comparisons of the reconstructed gene trees to simulated lineages support the notion that variation in call cannot be simply explained by population history.
   Conclusion: Discordance among traits may reflect sampling biases (e. g. single genetic marker effects), or imply a decoupling of evolution of different suites of characters. Diagnostic differences among populations in call structure possibly reflect local selection pressures presented by different heterospecific calling assemblages and may serve as a precursor of species-wide differentiation. Differentiation among populations in morphology may be due to ecophenotypic variation or to diversifying selection on body size directly, or on frequency attributes of calls ( mediated by female choice) that show a strong relationship to body size.

AB Tropical forest recovery in pastures is slowed by a number of biotic and abiotic factors, including a lack of adequate seed dispersal and harsh microclimatic extremes. Accordingly, methods to accelerate forest recovery must address multiple impediments. Here, we evaluated the ability of "tree islands" to serve as "recruitment foci" 2 in a two-year study at three sites in northern Honduras. Islands of three sizes (64, 16, and 4 m) and at two distances to secondary forest (20 and 50 m) were created by planting 2 m tall vegetative stakes of two native species: Gliricidia sepium (Fabaceae) and Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae), each in monoculture. Open-pasture "islands" of equal sizes served as controls. Tree islands reduced temperature and light (PAR) extremes as compared to open pasture, creating a microenvironment more favorable to seedling establishment. Seed-dispersing birds (quantified at one site only) showed an overwhelming preference for islands; 160 visits were recorded to islands compared with one visit to open pasture. Additionally, frugivores visited large islands more often, and for longer time periods, than small islands, thereby increasing the likelihood of a dispersal event there. In total, 144 140 seeds belonging to 186 species were collected in islands; more than 80% were grasses. Tree islands increased zoochorous tree seed rain; seed density and species richness were greater in tree islands than in open pasture, and large islands had greater seed density than smaller islands (Gliricidia only), suggesting that they are more effective for restoration. Distance to forest did not affect seed rain. A total of 543 seedlings and 41 species established in islands; > 85% were zoochorous. Seedling density did not differ among treatments (mean 0.2 seedlings/m(2) for islands vs. 0.1 seedlings/m(2) for pasture), although an increasing trend in tree islands over the course of two years suggests that seedling recruitment is accelerated there. Lastly, similar seedling densities were censused in the I m perimeter surrounding islands, suggesting that islands can expand outward into pasture. Planting vegetative stakes to create tree islands in pastures accelerates forest recovery by overcoming a number of impediments, and presents a simple, broadly applicable alternative for facilitating forest regeneration in abandoned pastures.

AB We quantified the effect of overstory species composition on forest floor dynamics in lowland Costa Rica. Aboveground litter production and forest floor mass were measured over 1 year in 16-year-old single-species plantations established in a randomized complete block design with four blocks. The tree species investigated (=experimental treatments) were Hyeronima alchorneoides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Pinus patula subsp. tecunumanii, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia ferruginea, and Vochysia guatemalensis. Organic matter fluxes in litterfall, which averaged 10.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), were similar to those reported from comparable Neotropical plantations, whereas nitrogen fluxes in litterfall (up to 210 kgN ha(-1) year(-1)) were high. Litter production was significantly greater beneath Hyeronima and V. ferruginea than beneath Virola, primarily due to high rates of non-woody litter production by Hyeronima, large amounts of twig litter production by V. ferruginea, and low production of both fractions by Virola. V. ferruginea had significantly more branch litter on the ground than did any other species, whereas Hyeronima had the largest accumulations of non-woody (mostly leaf) litter. Accumulations of woody litter correlated closely with rates of branchfall: branches <= 1 cm in diameter persisted on the forest floor for 0.9 year on average, independent of species. Rates of decay of non-woody litter, in contrast, varied significantly among species, with fastest rates (2.8 year(-1)) observed beneath Pentaclethra and the slowest decay rates (1.5 year(-1)) in plots of V. guatemalensis. Contrary to expectations, litter decay rates increased with increasing lignin contents, paralleling results of a concomitant study that found a significant negative correlation between litter lignin and surface-soil organic matter content. Our results demonstrate that different overstory-tree species generate significantly different forest floors, in terms of mass, composition and dynamics. These differences affect soil restoration, tree regeneration and other ecological processes important to selecting species for tropical plantation establishment and reforestation efforts.

AB Understanding the dependency of ecosystem processes on spatial and temporal scales is crucial in current efforts to model ecosystem responses to global change. Here we present a case of nonlinear interactions between temporal and spatial scales in a high spatial- and temporal-resolution study of fine-root biomass responses to edaphic and climatic variation in a lowland tropical rain forest (La Selva, Costa Rica). The spatiotemporal variation in fine roots in this forest was considerably greater than that for aboveground live biomass and litterfall. Standing stocks of both live and dead fine roots varied strongly during a seven-year period (up to 10-fold) and across two edaphic gradients with different soil nutrient and water variation (up to four-fold). Fine-root biomass decreased with soil fertility and volumetric soil water content, but responses across a landscape gradient (decreasing with total soil P and K and increasing with N:P ratio between two Oxisols with different weathering) differed from those across a topographic gradient in older Oxisols (increasing with total Fe and Al and decreasing with Ca, Mg, and C:N ratio down the slopes). The spatial contrasts across the landscape gradient (but not in the topographic gradient) changed substantially through time, and they, in fact, disappeared entirely by the middle of the study interval. Shortterm monitoring of belowground standing biomass could thus lead to important biases when quantifying root responses. The positive time X gradient interaction in fine-root biomass across soil types (but not downslope) also indicates nonlinear changes in spatial patterns across temporal scales, so studies on temporal responses also need to be spatially explicit at narrow scales. This interaction also appears to be more complex than previously recognized: semester-averaged fine-root biomass was negatively correlated with soil water content in the preceding semester, but the relationship was restricted to residual Oxisols. To increase the accuracy of global carbon cycle models in the future, a critical complement to observations of ecosystem processes at regional and global scales will be quantifying these processes through multiple years and across the substantial edaphic gradients that typically exist within landscapes.

AB Birds play vital roles as seed dispersers helping to maintain and restore plant communities. With restoration increasingly key to global conservation, it is important to understand the landscape attributes and bird community characteristics that most influence avian seed dispersal in human-altered landscapes. We examined bird community structure and seed-dispersal patterns in agricultural countryside in Costa Rica that is typical of much of the Neotropics. Contrary to expectations, bird abundance, not richness, best predicted the richness of bird-dispersed seeds. Neither forest patch size or proximity, nor total tree cover, influenced seed dispersal. The richness and abundance of dispersed seeds, however, was strongly correlated with "wetness," a remotely-sensed metric of vegetation, at several scales. These results suggest that in this human-dominated tropical region: (1) bird abundance, not species richness or size, may drive seed dispersal, and (2) remote-sensing combined with field verification can detect landscape elements that are helpful for maintaining the option of bird-mediated reforestation.

AB Leaf Area Index (leaf area per unit ground area, LAI) is a key driver of forest productivity but has never previously been measured directly at the landscape scale in tropical rain forest (TRF). We used a modular tower and stratified random sampling to harvest all foliage from forest floor to canopy top in 55 vertical transects (4.6 m(2)) across 500 ha of old growth in Costa Rica. Landscape LAI was 6.00 +/- 0.32 SEM. Trees, palms and lianas accounted for 89% of the total, and trees and lianas were 95% of the upper canopy. All vertical transects were organized into quantitatively defined strata, partially resolving the long-standing controversy over canopy stratification in TRF. Total LAI was strongly correlated with forest height up to 21 m, while the number of canopy strata increased with forest height across the full height range. These data are a benchmark for understanding the structure and functional composition of TRF canopies at landscape scales, and also provide insights for improving ecosystem models and remote sensing validation.

AB The relationship between phenology and tree stem diameter increment is largely unexplored in tropical species, especially in wet tropical forests. To explore links between these phenomena, we measured stem diameter increment and phenology often canopy tree species from a range of functional types in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica to test for seasonal and interannual patterns. We measured stem diameter increment using band dendrometers and visually assessed leaf and reproductive phenology monthly from 1997 to 2000. We categorized the species into groups based on patterns of leaf exchange and reproduction. Species were either deciduous with synchronous or asynchronous leaf drop, or evergreen with continuous or seasonal leaf flushing. Flowering occurred supra-annually, annually, or continuously. Of the ten species studied, four species, Cecropia insignis, Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, and Simarouba amara, had consistent seasonal stem diameter increment patterns in both years. Dipteryx panamensis and L. ampla were deciduous with synchronized leaf drop. Cecropia insignis was evergreen and produced new leaves continuously. Simarouba amara, also evergreen, exchanged leaves over a brief period once a year. We tested whether stem diameter increment was correlated to phenology using logistic regression. Leaflessness significantly explained patterns in stem diameter increment but reproductive phenology did not. Deciduous trees were 2.6-9.3 times more likely to grow less than average the month following leaffall than in months when trees had full crowns.

AB Remnant trees have been widely reported to facilitate tropical forest recovery, however, few restoration strategies can mimic the role such trees play in their absence. This study evaluated the establishment success and growth of planting oversized vegetative 'stakes' (>4 m tall) of three species: Ficus pertusa (Moraceae), Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae), and Erythrina poeppigiana (Fabaceae) at three different sites in southern Costa Rica. I found high establishment rates for all species (range 67-100%) with no mortality for Erythrina. This result was coupled with a rapid development of canopy area over 1 yr for Erythrina (7.69 +/- 0.86 m(2)) and Bursera (1.82 +/- 0.86 m(2)), but not Ficus (0.23 +/- 0.04 m(2)). Similar results are reported for height. The study presents an important new addition to the growing body of literature on the use of stakes in tropical restoration, where, oversized stakes may be planted as solitary individuals in restoration sites to mimic the role played by remnant trees in forest recovery.

AB Background and Aims In tropical lowland rain forest (TLRF) the leaves of most monocots differ from those of most dicots in two ways that may reduce attack by herbivores. Firstly, they are tougher. Secondly, the immature leaves are tightly folded or rolled until 50-100 % of their final length. It was hypothesized that (a) losses of leaf area to herbivorous invertebrates are generally greatest during leaf expansion and smaller for monocots than for dicots, and (b) where losses after expansion are appreciable any difference between monocots and dicots then is smaller than that found during expansion.
   Methods At six sites on four continents, estimates were made of lamina area loss from the four most recently mature leaves of focal monocots and of the nearest dicot shoot. Measurements of leaf mass per unit area, and the concentrations of water and nitrogen were made for many of the species. In Panama, the losses from monocots (palms) and dicots were also measured after placing fully expanded palm leaflets and whole dicot leaves on trails of leaf-cutter ants.
   Key Results At five of six sites monocots experienced significantly smaller leaf area loss than dicots. The results were not explicable in terms of leaf mass per unit area, or concentrations of water or nitrogen. At only one site was the increase in loss from first to fourth mature leaf significant (also large and the same in monocots and dicots), but the losses sustained during expansion were much smaller in the monocots. In the leaf-cutter ant experiment, losses were much smaller for palms than for dicots.
   Conclusions The relationship between toughness and herbivory is complex; despite the negative findings of some recent authors for dicots we hypothesize that either greater toughness or late folding can protect monocot leaves against herbivorous insects in tropical lowland rain forest, and that the relative importance varies widely with species. The difficulties of establishing unequivocally the roles of leaf toughness and leaf folding or rolling in a given case are discussed.

AB 1. Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative 'global pollination crisis' there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities.
   2. We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0.25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons.
   3. Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns.
   4. Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found.
   5. These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees.

AB Question: What is the influence of remnant trees on secondary forest structure and composition in tropical pastures many years after abandonment?
   Location: Neotropical lowland wet forest, La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
   Methods: Tree and sapling density, basal area, and species richness were quantified at three distances from remnant trees, 0 - 10 m ( inner), 20 - 30 m ( intermediate), and ca. 50 m ( distal) zones. A total of 15 remnant trees were sampled in pastures similar to 23 years after abandonment.
   Results: Tree density decreased along a gradient from inner ( 1117 +/- 377 individuals/ ha) to distal ( 592 +/- 282 individuals/ ha) zones, and the number of large- seeded individuals ( seeds > 1 cm diameter) was significantly greater in the inner zone. Basal area of tree individuals was greater in the inner ( 25.6 +/- 12 m(2)/ ha) and intermediate ( 28.3 +/- 15.6 m(2)/ ha) zones than the distal zone ( 14.7 +/- 7.2 m2/ ha), but there were no differences between inner and intermediate zones. Similar patterns are reported for species richness. Additionally, saplings ( 1 - 5 cm DBH) had higher density directly beneath and adjacent to remnants, suggesting that remnant trees can affect recruitment even many years after pasture abandonment and the formation of a surrounding secondary forest.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that remnant trees facilitate forest recovery over a broad temporal range, and appear to ' nucleate' forest regeneration by expanding their sphere of influence outward over time.

AB Romina E. Principe (2008) Taxonomic and size structures of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in different habitats of tropical streams, Costa Rica. Zoological Studies 47(5): 525-534. Taxonomic and size structures of macro invertebrate assemblages associated with different habitats of tropical streams of Costa Rica were analyzed. Surber samples were taken in riffle and run habitats in 2 streams. Invertebrates were identified and measured, and the biomass was estimated. The taxonomic richness and total abundance were higher in riffle habitats. Correspondence analysis showed a clear separation between riffle and run samples. The IndVal method identified the characteristic assemblages in each habitat type. Tricladida, Hydrachnidia, Leptophlebiidae, Hydropsychidae, Simulium sp., Corynoneurini, Orthocladiinae, and Empididae showed significant indicator values for riffle habitats: whereas Bivalvia, Tanypodinae, and Chironomini were the characteristic taxa from runs. The length-frequency distribution of riffles differed from that in runs in both streams as measured by Kolmogorov-Smimov tests. The largest organisms were found in run habitats, with macroinvertebrates belonging to the 1st size class being the most abundant in riffles. Although larger organisms were found in runs, differences in total biomass between habitats were not observed due to the high number of small invertebrates collected in riffles. The size spectrum for the entire benthic community showed that the total biomass was relatively equitably distributed among the size classes, although a peak was suggested for medium size classes. When the size spectrum was separately analyzed in each habitat, a peak was also suggested in riffles. Differences in the physical attributes of riffles and runs were clearly reflected in the taxonomic composition of the size spectra. Patterns observed in taxonomic and size structures may indicate different ecological functioning at the habitat level in the tropical streams studied. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/47.5/525.pdf

AB One manner in which elephants utilize trees is by removing their bark. This type of utilization is concentrated on the largest trees in the landscape. The role of bark removal in increasing the vulnerability of large trees to fire and the mechanism through which fire damage is mediated were investigated in Kruger National Park. South Africa, by experimentally removing bark and burning Acacia nigrescens stems with diameters ranging between 30 and 68 mm. Also, field surveys were conducted subsequent to natural fires in order to investigate mortality patterns of large trees with dbh greater than 15 cm with bark removed by elephants. An increasing probability of mortality was associated with increasing amounts of bark removal but only if trees were burned. When trees had bark removed but were not burnt, simulating damage only to cambium and phloem, none of the 12 treated stems died in the 4-mo period over which the experimentran. Moreover, low levels of cambium damage were detected in large burned stems. This suggests that bark removal increases fire-induced xylem damage and that this damage contributes towards stein mortality. In a survey of 437 large trees. bark removal by elephants was frequent on large stems (44%) and larger trees have greater amounts of bark removed. Post-fire mortality of large trees was significantly associated with increasing bark removal and stem diameter. These results indicate that bark removal by elephants increases the vulnerability of stems to fire, resulting in mortality of large stems otherwise protected from fire.

AB No other line of practice requires application of science More urgently than conservation. Here we explore several elements that must be pill in place to establish lines of communication between scientists, and managers of protected areas. First, it is necessary that scientists tire aware of the information needs of managers. that they produce the. relevant information, and that this information is available to managers. Second, it is necessary that managers not only know how access, process and incorporate the information, but that they also internalize their need for that science and the clear advantages, of incorporating it into their practice. We propose several mechanisms' to ensure tilt adequate flow of information between the two groups: active dialogue between the parties, translators of science located both in academia and government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and execution of joint projects. In particular. we argue that science-oriented NGOs can play a major role in bridging the gap between basic science and on-the-ground conservation. We finish by describing three ease studies ill which some of thee models have been explored in Colombia and how science has been applied to address conservation and management concerns.

ID RECRUITMENT; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; HISTORY
AB Estimation of tree growth is generally based on repeated diameter measurements. A buttress at the height of measurement will lead to overestimates of tree diameter. Because buttresses grow LIP the trunk through time. it has become common practice to increase the height: of measurement, to ensure that measurements remain above the buttress. However, tapering of the trunk means that increasing measurement height will bias estimates of diameter downward by up to 10% per m of height. This bias Could affect inference concerning species differences and climate effects on tree demography and on biomass accumulation. Here we introduce a hierarchical state space method that allows formal integration of data on diameter taken at different heights and can include individual variation, temporal effects or other covariates. We illustrate our approach using species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. and La Selva, Costa Rica. Results include trends that are consistent with some of those previously reported for climate responses and changes over time, but differ in relative magnitude. By including the full data-set and accounting for bias and variation among individuals and over time, our approach allows for quantification of climate responses and the uncertainty associated with measurements and the underlying growth process.

TI Tree responses to edge effects and canopy openness in a tropical montane

SO TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE

DE Fragmentation; Gap dynamics; Las Cruces Biological Station; Species
   composition; Species richness
AB Tropical forests frequently experience the opening and closing of canopy gaps as part of their natural dynamics. When fragmented, the forests are also exposed to edges, which (at least in the lowlands) cause increased mortality on the fragment's periphery and-depending on the fragment size-also on the forest interior. Here we explore if the presence of edges increase the rate at which the canopy opens in a montane forest and if and how that interaction affects the vegetation composition and structure. At Las Cruces Biological Station (SW Costa Rica), we surveyed four 150 m edge-to-interior transects to evaluate changes in vegetation structure (stem density and basal area for all plants with DBH > 5 cm) and species richness and composition as a function of both distance to the edge and canopy openness. Edge proximity did not increase canopy openness. Canopy openness, however, did affect stem density, species richness, and composition. Consequently, heterogeneity in forest structure, diversity, or composition could not be attributed to indirect edge effects. Forest edges, however, had a direct effect on species composition, but with a negligible effect on species diversity and forest structure. Overall, these results reveal that the structure, diversity, and composition of tree communities in this tropical premontane forest fragment are more strongly influenced by canopy openness than by the proximity of edges.

AB Lianas (woody vines) are an important component of tropical forests, with a strong impact on forest dynamics, but their responses during forest succession have received relatively little attention. Here, we present an analysis of the changes in stern density, biomass, and species richness of lianas and self-supporting plants during tropical forest succession. We surveyed lianas >= 0.5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) and self-supporting plants >= 2.5 cm dbh in 0.1 ha inventory plots in a chronosequence of 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, 23 sites on abandoned pastures 10-44 years of age, and seven sites in old-growth forest. Stem density of self-supporting plants showed no predictable chronosequence trend, but liana stem density declined significantly with forest age. Aboveground biomass of self-supporting vegetation increased rapidly during Succession, with forests 31-44 years exhibiting higher levels of biomass than old-growth forests. Liana biomass accumulated more slowly, with the highest levels in old-growth sites. Species richness of self-supporting vegetation increased significantly during succession, but species richness of lianas showed no change or a slight decline with forest age, depending on the method of assessment. The differences between tree and liana responses during succession stem from the unique physiology and life history traits of lianas. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Litter decomposition recycles nutrients and causes large fluxes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is typically assumed that climate, litter quality and decomposer communities determine litter decay rates, yet few comparative studies have examined their relative contributions in tropical forests.
   2. We used a short-term litterbag experiment to quantify the effects of litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion on decomposition in 23 tropical forests in 14 countries. Annual precipitation varied among sites (760-5797 mm). At each site, two standard substrates (Raphia farinifera and Laurus nobilis) were decomposed in fine- and coarse-mesh litterbags both above and below ground for approximately 1 year.
   3. Decomposition was rapid, with >95% mass loss within a year at most sites. Litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion all independently affected decomposition, but the magnitude depended upon site. Both the average decomposition rate at each site and the ratio of above- to below-ground decay increased linearly with annual precipitation, explaining 60-65% of among-site variation. Excluding mesofauna had the largest impact on decomposition, reducing decomposition rates by half on average, but the magnitude of decrease was largely independent of climate. This suggests that the decomposer community might play an important role in explaining patterns of decomposition among sites. Which litter type decomposed fastest varied by site, but was not related to climate.
   4. Synthesis. A key goal of ecology is to identify general patterns across ecological communities, as well as relevant site-specific details to understand local dynamics. Our pan-tropical study shows that certain aspects of decomposition, including average decomposition rates and the ratio of above- to below-ground decomposition are highly correlated with a simple climatic index: mean annual precipitation. However, we found no relationship between precipitation and effects of mesofaunal exclusion or litter type, suggesting that site-specific details may also be required to understand how these factors affect decomposition at local scales.

AB Efforts to restore tropical forest in abandoned pasture are likely to be more successful when bird visitation is promoted because birds disperse seeds and eat herbivorous arthropods that damage leaves. Thus, it is critical to understand bird behavior in relation to different restoration strategies. We measured the likelihood of visitation, number of visits, and duration of visits for all birds and for Cherrie's Tanager (Ramphocelus costaricensis), a common seed disperser, in five sizes of forest restoration patches planted with four tree species in southern Costa Rica. We predicted that the largest patches, and the tree species with the greatest canopy cover, would be visited most frequently and have the longest visits because we assumed that these patch types had the greatest food resources and the lowest predation risk. We found that birds were more likely to visit large patches and the tree species with the highest canopy cover (Inga edulis). Birds visited Inga trees more often and stayed in Inga and Erythrina poeppigiana trees for longer periods of time than in other tree species. We found similar results for Cherrie's Tanagers. Thus, we identified two factors, tree species and patch size, which may be manipulated in restoration projects to increase bird visitation.

AB Abrupt forest disturbances generating gaps >0.001 km(2) impact roughly 0.4-0.7 million km(2) a(-1). Fire, windstorms, logging, and shifting cultivation are dominant disturbances; minor contributors are land conversion, flooding, landslides, and avalanches. All can have substantial impacts on canopy biomass and structure. Quantifying disturbance location, extent, severity, and the fate of disturbed biomass will improve carbon budget estimates and lead to better initialization, parameterization, and/or testing of forest carbon c ycle models. Spaceborne remote sensing maps large-scale forest disturbance occurrence, location, and extent, particularly with moderate- and fine-scale resolution passive optical/near-infrared (NIR) instruments. High-resolution remote sensing (e. g., similar to 1 m passive optical/NIR, or small footprint lidar) can map crown geometry and gaps, but has rarely been systematically applied to study small-scale disturbance and natural mortality gap dynamics over large regions. Reducing uncertainty in disturbance and recovery impacts on global forest carbon balance requires quantification of (1) predisturbance forest biomass; (2) disturbance impact on standing biomass and its fate; and (3) rate of biomass accumulation during recovery. Active remote sensing data (e. g., lidar, radar) are more directly indicative of canopy biomass and many structural properties than passive instrument data; a new generation of instruments designed to generate global coverage/sampling of canopy biomass and structure can improve our ability to quantify the carbon balance of Earth's forests. Generating a high-quality quantitative assessment of disturbance impacts on canopy biomass and structure with spaceborne remote sensing requires comprehensive, well designed, and well coordinated field programs collecting high-quality ground-based data and linkages to dynamical models that can use this information.

AB Secondary forests are a vital part of the tropical landscape, and their worldwide extent and importance continues to increase. Here, we present the largest chronosequence data set on forest succession in the wet tropics that includes both secondary and old-growth sites. We performed 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, including seven old-growth forests and 23 secondary forests on former pastures, ranging from 10 to 42 yr. The secondary forest sites were formerly pasture for intervals of < 1-25 yr. Aboveground biomass in secondary forests recovered rapidly, with sites already exhibiting values comparable to old growth after 21-30 yr, and biomass accumulation was not impacted by the length of time that a site was in pasture. Species richness reached old-growth levels in as little as 30 yr, although sites that were in pasture for > 10 yr had significantly lower species richness. Forest cover near the sites at the time of forest establishment did not significantly impact biomass or species richness, and the species composition of older secondary forest sites (> 30 yr) converged with that of old growth. These results emphasize the resilience of tropical ecosystems in this region and the high conservation value of secondary forests.

AB Much of the dry tropical forest biome has been converted to agricultural land uses over the past several centuries. However, in conservation areas such as those in the Guanacaste and Tempisque regions of Costa Rica, tropical dry forests are regenerating due to management practices including fire suppression. To better understand the patterns of secondary succession occurring in Costa Rican tropical dry forest, we established 60 20 x 50 m plots in mature and regenerating forests in the Sector Santa Rosa (formerly known as Parque Nacional Santa Rosa) and Palo Verde National Park. Plots were stratified into three plant communities: tropical dry oak forest (Quercus oleoides) (SROAK), Santa Rosa tropical dry forest (SRTDF), and Palo Verde tropical dry forest (PVTDF). In these plots we measured and identified and all individuals > 10 cm DBH, measured but did not identify stems < 10 cm but taller than 1.3 m, counted woody seedlings (<1.3 m height) and analyzed soil chemical and physical properties.
   Soil properties clearly differentiated vegetation communities and defined a gradient from rocky, siltier soils with low nutrient availability (SROAK soils) to clayey, nutrient-rich soils (PVTDF). Soils in the Santa Rosa dry forest had intermediate soil properties compared to the other two plant communities and had the highest tree species richness. Successional dynamics as assessed from plots of different age showed that the patterns of change in indices of stand structure, species richness and tree community composition varied with forest type (and hence soil properties). Forest structure (densities of stems in different size classes) recovered to levels found in mature forest within 4-5 decades in SRTDF and PVTDF, but increased with stand age in the oak forest. in all plots, we identified 135 species from 45 families. Simple and partial Mantel tests showed that across all plots, both stand age and soil properties explain variation in species composition, but that there is also unexplained spatial variation in tree community composition after accounting for spatial co-variation with soils. Additional analyses suggested that this is due to P-diversity, i.e. changes in the regional species pool from the northern (Santa Rosa) to more southern area (Palo Verde). Species composition in young stands was dominated by wind-dispersed species in SRTDF and PVTDF, and by animal-dispersed species in the oak forest. We conclude that the management strategy of fire control promotes passive regeneration of secondary dry forest in Costa Rica. However, if a specific forest composition is desired, more active restoration strategies may be necessary. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reserva Natural Absoluta Cabo Blanco, a strongly seasonal deciduous forest located at the southern-most tip of northwestern Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, was established in 1963 and is the country's oldest nationally protected reserve. The peninsula has been occupied for millennia and is a heavily impacted landscape, and, unfortunately, its biotic diversity is among the most poorly studied in Central America. As part of multiyear studies of the flora and fauna of the region, we assess the changes in vegetation and the terrestrial mammal community from earlier times to the present day. Through historical records, interviews with long-term residents of the area, and our studies over the past decade, we document changes in forest cover, settlement, and land use, and assess the changes in species diversity and in mammal species' abundance. We then discuss the ecology of the mammal species on the peninsula, emphasizing the role that humans have played in influencing population levels.
   After 45 years of protection, the forest structure of the 3100 ha reserve differs markedly from that observed in the early 20th Century and it is quite heterogeneous. Species diversity of both the native vegetation and the mammals is substantial in the regenerating forest. The known mammal fauna included at least 37 species of non-flying mammals and 39 species of bats. Six species (Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, Giant Anteater, White-lipped Peccary, Central American Red Brocket Deer, Baird's Tapir, and Jaguar) have been extirpated from the reserve. Poaching of game species continues and will be difficult to eliminate completely. Nevertheless, with regenerating habitats, coupled with protection of wildlife, reestablishment of the reserve's native species has been dramatic both in terms of species diversity and abundance. The reserve is not in a defaunated condition. Many mammalian frugivores, seed dispersers, and/or seed predators are common and most top mammalian predators are present. We present several testable hypotheses regarding the significance of this mammalian community in the context of other Neotropical forest mammal and plant communities. Rapid expansion of tourism in this region has the potential to affect the reserve adversely. In recent years, the reserve has served as an important site for teaching tropical biology courses. Small reserves, such as Cabo Blanco, even if not connected to larger protected areas through corridors, provide critical habitat for native flora and fauna, a source of genetic stock, and valuable regional teaching and research sites.

AB In tropical rain forests, rates of forest turnover and tree species' life-history differences are shaped by the life expectancy of trees and the time taken by seedlings to reach the canopy. These measures are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However, the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment, age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent). We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size from growth rings and (14)C from some of the same species at the same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new results for life histories of tropical trees.

AB Tree seedlings are commonly planted to restore abandoned agricultural lands, whereas vegetative plantings have received little study. We evaluated the ability of 10 tree species to establish and survive over 3 years by planting 2-m-tall vegetative stakes at three sites in southern Costa Rica. We quantified above- and belowground stake and seedling biomass for two species (Erythrina poeppigiana and Gliricidia sepium) after 1 year and canopy cover and height of E. poeppigiana stakes and saplings at 3 years. We also compared economic, logistical, and ecological advantages of each methodology. Erythrina poeppigiana and E. berteroana had the highest number of live stakes by the study's conclusion (> 90%) and were among species with largest canopies. Most others ranged between 40 and 70% with highly site-specific survival and growth rates, whereas three species did poorly. Four species developed fruit by year 3, including Ficus pertusa and Acnistus arborescens, that are consumed by frugivores. Above- and belowground biomass was 7-50 times greater in stakes (65-125 g) than seedlings (2-15 g). Stake roots were considerably more extensive and reached lengths more than 6 m. Erythrina poeppigiana stakes had higher canopy cover than saplings after 3 years but not height. Seedlings are 2-10 times more expensive to establish, although transporting stakes is more cumbersome and the suite of species that establish vegetatively is limited. This underused technique should be included in the growing repertoire of tropical forest restoration tools. Given tradeoffs in propagation methods, a combination is likely to be most efficient and successful.

AB The phylogenetic structure of ecological communities can shed light on assembly processes, but the focus of phylogenetic structure research thus far has been on mature ecosystems. Here, I present the first investigation of phylogenetic community structure during succession. In a replicated chronosequence of 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, I found strong phylogenetic overdispersion at multiple scales: species present at local sites were a non-random assemblage, more distantly related than chance would predict. Phylogenetic overdispersion was evident when comparing the species present at each site with the regional species pool, the species pool found in each age category to the regional pool or the species present at each site to the pool of species found in sites of that age category. Comparing stem size classes within each age category, I found that during early succession, phylogenetic overdispersion is strongest in small stems. Overdispersion strengthens and spreads into larger size classes as succession proceeds, corroborating an existing model of forest succession. This study is the first evidence that succession leaves a distinct signature in the phylogenetic structure of communities.

AB Increased atmospheric [CO2] could theoretically lead to increased forest productivity ('CO2 fertilization'). This mechanism was hypothesized as a possible explanation for biomass increases reported from tropical forests in the last 30+ years. We used unique long-term records of annually measured stands (eighteen 0.5 ha plots, 10 years) and focal tree species (six species, 24 years) to assess the effects of rainfall, temperature, and atmospheric [CO2] on annual wood production in a neotropical rain forest. Our study area was a meso-scale section (600 ha) of old-growth Tropical Wet Forest in NE Costa Rica. Using the repeated remeasurements we directly assessed the relative effects of interannual climatic variation and increasing atmospheric [CO2] on wood production. A remarkably simple two-factor model explained 91% of the interannual variance in stand-level tree growth; the statistically independent factors were total dry season rainfall (positive effect, r2=0.85) and night-time temperature (negative effect, r2=0.42). Stand-level tree mortality increased significantly with night-time temperature. After accounting for dry season rainfall and night-time temperature, there was no effect of annual [CO2] on tree growth in either the stand or focal species data. Tree growth in this Tropical Wet Forest was surprisingly sensitive to the current range of dry season conditions and to variations in mean annual night-time temperature of 1-2 degrees. Our results suggest that wood production in the lowland rainforests of NE Costa Rica (and by extension in other tropical regions) may be severely reduced in future climates that are only slightly drier and/or warmer.

AB An obligate symbiosis between Ocotea dendrodaphne Mez and O. atirrensis Mez & Donn.Sm. (Lauraceae) and their cryptic ant symbiont, Myrmelachista flavocotea, is common in lowland wet forests of Costa Rica, yet it is unclear whether the association is typically mutualistic or parasitic. Ants impose costs by tending trophobionts inside the plant body and further compromise the structural integrity of their host by hollowing its stems. Benefits to the host, including anti-herbivore defense and nutrient provisioning, must outweigh these costs for the association to be mutualistic, but benefits in this system are largely unknown. We adopted a stable isotope approach to investigate trophic relationships among Ocotea hosts, coccoid trophobionts, and worker and larval ants in the understory of mature forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. In addition, a natural stable isotope marker (tuna) was made available to M. flavocotea colonies to determine whether ants are fortuitous scavengers and/or provision their host. In this system, we found unusual patterns of isotopic fractionation. For coccoids, nitrogen isotopes are only slightly enriched, and carbon isotopes were depleted relative to the host signature. Moreover, nitrogen signatures of the timid Myrmelachista ants are high, suggesting a substantial degree of carnivory and/or scavenging in this species. In the provisioning study, ant colonies provided with baits demonstrated a significant shift in carbon isotopic composition relative to untreated colonies indicating uptake and assimilation of the bait. These results suggest that these timid ants are patrolling the plant for food and concentrating nutrients in Ocotea's hollowed stems. Further studies are required to confirm if M. flavocotea provides a net benefit to its host by providing nutrients, reducing herbivory, or by removing detrimental debris from the plants surface.

AB 1. Active restoration to rehabilitate degraded tropical lands often involves planting tree seedlings, an effective but expensive approach if large areas are planted. Planting small patches of vegetation (tens to a few hundred square metres) has recently been suggested as a more economical restoration technique that mimics natural regeneration processes. However, few studies have examined the consequences of restoration patch size on animals, whose presence and activities are often key to successful ecosystem recovery.
   2. We examined the effects of patch size on the foraging behaviour of four resident tropical bird species in a replicated forest restoration experiment in southern Costa Rica. We also measured arthropod abundance and anti-predator vigilance behaviour to assess whether variation in food availability or predation risk could explain patch size effects on foraging behaviour.
   3. Prey attack rates were highest, and the effort required to find prey was lowest, in larger patches for three of the four bird species. Arthropod density was approximately twice as great in larger patches (> 3500 m(2)) compared with smaller patches (< 350 m(2)). Evidence for patch size differences in predation risk was more limited but risk may be higher in smaller patches. The results indicate that food availability is the primary mechanism driving patch size effects on foraging behaviour, with predation risk being an additional influence for some species in some years.
   4. Synthesis and applications. As demonstrated in this study, patches of tens to a few hundreds of metres squared are likely to provide fewer food resources and potentially less cover from predators for vertebrates that use woody habitat, compared with patches of a few thousand square metres. The more limited resources in smaller patches are likely to have short-term and, potentially, long-term consequences for the fitness of organisms. When considering restoration project design, the potential economic and other benefits of planting in smaller patches must be weighed with the potentially negative ecological effects on some taxonomic groups. To increase the probability that patches provide adequate habitat for the largest number of species, we recommend that when financial resources are available, patches of at least a few thousand square metres be planted.

AB Field methods for determining the sex of birds are often limited due to morphometric overlap between sexes, intermediate plumages, seasonality, and reliance on subjective age classification. Interpubic distance, characterized in birds as the distance between the distal ends of the pubic bones, has not been formally tested as a method for determining the sex of birds, despite references among parrot breeders and the frequent use of analogous measurements in mammals. We developed a harmless and easily performed field method for measuring interpubic distance in studies involving bird capture, and compared the interpubic distances of known sex White-ruffed Manakins (Corapipo altera), Orange-collared Manakins (Manacus aurantiacus), and Blue-crowned Manakins (Lepidothrix coronata) to evaluate the possible use of this measurement to determine sex. Using interpubic distance ranges based on 85% confidence intervals where overlap existed between sexes, the sex of 92.8-100% of all manakins in our study was accurately determined with no misclassification. Interpubic distance performed better than plumage-based methods that sexed 74.0% of all individuals and misclassified 1.5%. Using linear discriminant analysis, we developed classification equations that allowed us to accurately determine the sex of all individuals with 100% accuracy using mass and interpubic distance. Additionally, we compared the interpubic distances of female White-ruffed Manakins to evaluate the potential to determine age and reproductive status. Despite an apparent relationship between interpubic distance, age and reproductive status, we concluded that interpubic distance has limited use for determining age and reproductive status due to extensive overlap (31.6-100%), but shows potential in other applications. Based on these results, we endorse the use of interpubic distance to determine the sex of manakins. We encourage further study to develop additional classification equations using different morphometric measurements and to test the efficacy of interpubic distance to determine sex in other bird species.

AB In this paper we present the results of an experiment to measure forest structure and biomass dynamics over the tropical forests of La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica using a medium resolution lidar. Our main objective was to observe changes in forest canopy height, related height metrics, and biomass, and from these map sources and sinks of carbon across the landscape. The Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) measured canopy structure over La Selva in 1998 and again in 2005. Changes in waveform metrics were related to field-derived changes in estimated aboveground biomass from a series of old growth and secondary forest plots. Pairwise comparisons of nearly coincident lidar footprints between years showed canopy top height changes that coincided with expected changes based on land cover types. Old growth forests had a net loss in height of -0.33 m, while secondary forests had net gain of 2.08 m. Multiple linear regression was used to relate lidar metrics with biomass changes for combined old growth and secondary forest plots, giving an r(2) of 0.65 and an RSE of 10.5 Mg/ha, but both parametric and bootstrapped confidence intervals were wide, suggesting weaker model performance. The plot level relationships were then used to map biomass changes across La Selva using LVIS at a 1 ha scale. The spatial patterns of biomass changes matched expected patterns given the distribution of land cover types at La Selva, with secondary forests showing a gain of 25 Mg/ha and old growth forests showing little change (2 Mg/ha). Prediction intervals were calculated to assess uncertainty for each 1 ha cell to ascertain whether the data and methods used could confidently estimate the sign (source or sink) of the biomass changes. The resulting map showed most of the old growth areas as neutral (no net biomass change), with widely scattered and isolated sources and sinks. Secondary forests in contrast were mostly sinks or neutral, but were never sources. By quantifying both the magnitude of biomass changes and the sensitivity of lidar to detect them, this work will help inform the formulation of future space missions focused on biomass dynamics, such as NASA's Deformation Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice mission.

AB In the moist tropical forest biome, which cycles carbon (C) rapidly and stores huge amounts of C, the impacts of individual species on C balances are not well known. In one of the earliest replicated experimental sites for investigating growth of native tropical trees, we examined traits of tree species in relation to their effects on forest C balances, mechanisms of influence, and consequences for C sequestration. The monodominant stands, established in abandoned pasture in 1988 at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, contained five species in a complete randomized block design. Native species were: Hieronyma alchorneoides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, and Vochysia guatemalensis. The exotic species was Pinus patula. By 16 years, the lack of differences among species in some attributes suggested strong abiotic control in this environment, where conditions are very favorable for growth. These attributes included aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), averaging 11.7 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) across species, and soil organic C (0-100 cm, 167 Mg C/ha). Other traits differed significantly, however, indicating some degree of biological control. In Vochysia plots, both aboveground biomass of 99 Mg C/ha, and belowground biomass of 20 Mg C/ha were 1.8 times that of Virola (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Differences among species in overstory biomass were not compensated by understory vegetation. Belowground NPP of 4.6 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) in Hieronyma was 2.4 times that of Pinus (P < 0.01). Partitioning of NPP to belowground components in Hieronyma was more than double that of Pinus (P = 0.03). The canopy turnover rate in Hieronyma was 42% faster than that of Virola (P < 0.01). Carbon sequestration, highest in Vochysia (7.4 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1), P = 0.02), averaged 5.2 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1), close to the annual per capita fossil fuel use in the United States of 5.3 Mg C. Our results indicated that differences in species effects on forest C balances were related primarily to differences in growth rates, partitioning of C among biomass components, tissue turnover rates, and tissue chemistry. Inclusion of those biological attributes may be critical for robust modeling of C cycling across the moist tropical forest biome.

AB Planting native tree seedlings is the predominant restoration strategy for accelerating forest succession on degraded lands. Planting tree "islands" is less costly and labor intensive than establishing larger plantations and simulates the nucleation process of succession. Assessing the role of island size in attracting seed dispersers, the potential of islands to expand through enhanced seed deposition, and the effect of planting arrangements on seed dispersal by birds and bats informs restoration design. Determining the relative importance of local restoration approach vs. landscape-level factors (amount of surrounding forest cover) helps prioritize methods and locations for restoration. We tested how three restoration approaches affect the arrival of forest seeds at 11 experimental sites spread across a gradient of surrounding forest cover in a 100-km(2) area of southern Costa Rica. Each site had three 50 x 50 m treatments: (1) control (natural regeneration), (2) island (planting tree seedlings in patches of three sizes: 16 m(2), 64 m(2), and 144 m(2)), and (3) plantation (planting entire area). Four tree species were used in planting (Terminalia amazonia, Vochysia guatemalensis, Erythrina poeppigiana, and Inga edulis). Seed rain was measured for 18 months beginning; similar to 2 years after planting.
   Plantations received the most zoochorous tree seeds (0266.1 +/- 64.5 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1) [ mean +/- SE]), islands were intermediate (210.4 +/- 52.7 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)), and controls were lowest (87.1 +/- 13.9 seeds.m (2).y(r-)1). Greater tree seed deposition in the plantations was due to birds (0.51 +/- 0.18 seeds.m (2).d(-1)), not bats (0.07 +/- 0.03 seeds.m (2).d(-1)). Seed rain was primarily small-seeded, early-successional species. Large and medium islands received twice as many zoochorous tree seeds as small islands and areas away from island edges, suggesting there is a minimum island size necessary to increase seed deposition and that seed rain outside of planted areas is strongly reduced. Planting design was more important for seed deposition than amount of forest cover within the surrounding 100- and 500-m radius areas. Establishing plantations and large islands facilitates the arrival of early-successional tree seeds and represents a broadly applicable strategy for increasing seed rain on abandoned agricultural lands. However, more intensive restoration approaches may be necessary for establishment of dispersal-limited species.

AB A small, 24V powered, portable mass spectrometer system, named ULISSES, for the study and visualization of gaseous volcanic emission is described. First deployments of the system have focused on both ground and airborne in situ measurement to monitor the awakening of the Turrialba Volcano in Costa Rica. Key gas measurements were acquired prior and after its eruption on 5 January 2010, confirming the presence of gas chemistry precursors typical of volcanic eruptions. Ground and airborne measurements were acquired to gain volcanological insight and as the first step towards the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as future airborne platforms and to confirm its unique capability to serve as a calibration/validation tool for satellite remote sensing data. Low parts per million (ppm) levels of helium and a large concentration of sulfur dioxide were measured in situ after the initial eruption. In particular, the SO2 data correlated with satellite remote sensing data. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the morphology of the sexual phase and spores of Platycerium andinum and Platycerium wandae. Spores were sown in Thompson's media and the cultures were kept at 24-25 degrees C, with 12 h light/darkness photoperiod. Developmental phases were fixed in FAA and processed for observation with the scanning electron microscope. Spores of both species are monolete: Vittaria-type germination and Aspidium-type prothallial development were observed. In the phase of development, the gametophytes develop unicellular secretory and as they mature, develop bifurcated or branched pluricellular trichomes, both in the cushion and near the meristematic zone. Adult gametophytes in culture are cordiform-spatulate to cordiform-reniform, most are unisexual and a few are bisexual. Gametangia belong to the le ptosporangiate fern type. Archegonial morphology is uniform, with an elongate, thin neck curved toward the base of the gametophyte. Antheridia have a basal cell, an annular cell and an undivided opercular cell. Three hundred days after the spores were sown, sporophytes still had not developed. In both species, some spores germinate inside the sporangial capsule (intra-sporangial germination). We provide new information on morphogenesis in the genus Platycerium. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Eleven types of plant megafossils are described in this study, including Laurophyllum, Oxandra, Piperites, Ingeae, Parinari, Sacoglottis, Byrsonima, and Pouteria. Detailed morphological and anatomical data are provided for each taxon. Although the Puerto Viejo site is situated in the Atlantic Lowland Tropical Wet Forest today, the fossil flora suggests a relationship with nearby modern forests at slightly higher elevation, and cooler paleotemperatures than at present.

AB As the human footprint expands, ecologists and resource managers are increasingly challenged to explain and manage abrupt ecosystem transformations (i.e., regime shifts). In this study, we investigated the role of a mechanical disturbance that has been used to restore and maintain local wetland diversity after a monotypic regime shift in northwestern Costa Rica [specifically, an abrupt landscape-scale cattail (Typha) expansion]. The study was conducted in Palo Verde Marsh (Palo Verde National Park; a RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance), a seasonally flooded freshwater wetland that has historically provided habitat for large populations of wading birds and waterfowl. A cattail (T. domingensis) expansion in the 1980s greatly altered the plant community and reduced avian habitat. Since then, Typha has been managed using a form of mechanical disturbance called fangueo (a Spanish word, pronounced "fahn-gay-yo" in English). We applied a Typha removal treatment at three levels (control, fangueo, and fangueo with fencing to exclude cattle grazing). Fangueo resulted in a large reduction in Typha dominance (i.e., decreased aboveground biomass, ramet density, and ramet height) and an increase in habitat heterogeneity. As in many ecosystems that have been defined by multiple and frequent disturbances, a large portion of the plant community regenerated after disturbance (via propagule banking) and fangueo resulted in a more diverse plant community that was strongly dictated by seasonal processes (i.e., distinct wet-and dry-season assemblages). Importantly, the mechanical disturbance had no apparent short-term impact on any of the soil properties we measured (including bulk density). Interestingly, low soil and foliar N:P values indicate that Palo Verde Marsh and other wetlands in the region may be nitrogen limited. Our results quantify how, in a cultural landscape where the historical disturbance regime has been altered and diversity has declined, a mechanical disturbance in combination with seasonal drought and flooding has been used to locally restrict a clonal monodominant plant expansion, create habitat heterogeneity, and maintain plant diversity.

AB In degraded tropical pastures, active restoration strategies have the potential to facilitate forest regrowth at rates that are faster than natural recovery, enhancing litterfall, and nutrient inputs to the forest floor. We evaluated litterfall and nutrient dynamics under four treatments: plantation (entire area planted), tree islands (planting in six patches of three sizes), control (same age natural regeneration), and young secondary forest (7-9-yr-old natural regeneration). Treatments were established in plots of 50 x 50 m at six replicate sites in southern Costa Rica and the annual litterfall production was measured 5 yr after treatment establishment. Planted species included two native timber-producing hardwoods (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) interplanted with two N-fixing species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana). Litter production was highest in secondary forests (7.3 Mg/ha/yr) and plantations (6.3), intermediate in islands (3.5), and lowest in controls (1.4). Secondary forests had higher input of all nutrients except N when compared with the plantation plots. Inga contributed 70 percent of leaffall in the plantations, demonstrating the influence that one species can have on litter quantity and quality. Although tree islands had lower litterfall rates, they were similar to plantations in inputs of Mg, K, P, Zn, and Mn. Tree islands increased litter production and nutrient inputs more quickly than natural regeneration. In addition to being less resource intensive than conventional plantations, this planting design promotes a more rapid increase in litter diversity and more spatial heterogeneity, which can accelerate the rate of nutrient cycling and facilitate forest recovery.

AB Natural regeneration of large-seeded, late-successional trees in fragmented tropical landscapes can be strongly limited by a lack of seed dispersal resulting in the need for more intensive restoration approaches, such as enrichment planting, to include these species in future forests. Direct seeding may be an alternative low-cost approach to planting nursery-raised tree seedlings, but there is minimal information on its efficacy or when in the successional process this technique will be most successful. We tested directly seeding five native tree species into habitats representing passive and active restoration approaches: (1) recently abandoned pasture; (2) naturally establishing, young secondary forests; and (3) young, mixed-species (fast-growing N-fixers and commercially valuable species) tree plantations established to facilitate montane forest recovery in southern Costa Rica. We monitored germination, survival, growth, and above- and below-ground biomass over a 2-year period. Germination in pastures, secondary forests, and tree plantations was similar(-..43%). Seedling survival after one and two years was significantly higher under tree plantations (91% year 1, 75% year 2) compared to secondary forests (76.44%) or pastures (74, 41%). Moreover, seedlings had greater total biomass and lower root:shoot ratios in the plantations, suggesting higher nutrient availability in that treatment. Costs for direct seeding were 10- to 30-fold less per 100 seedlings after 2-year compared to nursery-raised seedlings planted at the same sites; however, there are important trade-offs to the two restoration approaches. Planting nursery-raised seedling is a more effective but higher cost approach for rapidly establishing canopy cover and restoring large areas whereas direct seeding is a more efficient way to enrich an existing system. We particularly recommend using direct seeding as a complimentary measure to the more intensive restoration approach of planting fast-growing and N-fixing trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB We develop a novel statistical approach for classifying generalists and specialists in two distinct habitats. Using a multinomial model based on estimated species relative abundance in two habitats, our method minimizes bias due to differences in sampling intensities between two habitat types as well as bias due to insufficient sampling within each habitat. The method permits a robust statistical classification of habitat specialists and generalists, without excluding rare species a priori. Based on a user-defined specialization threshold, the model classifies species into one of four groups: (1) generalist; (2) habitat A specialist; (3) habitat B specialist; and (4) too rare to classify with confidence. We illustrate our multinomial classification method using two contrasting data sets: (1) bird abundance in woodland and heath habitats in southeastern Australia and (2) tree abundance in secondgrowth (SG) and old-growth (OG) rain forests in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We evaluate the multinomial model in detail for the tree data set. Our results for birds were highly concordant with a previous nonstatistical classification, but our method classified a higher fraction (57.7%) of bird species with statistical confidence. Based on a conservative specialization threshold and adjustment for multiple comparisons, 64.4% of tree species in the full sample were too rare to classify with confidence. Among the species classified, OG specialists constituted the largest class (40.6%), followed by generalist tree species (36.7%) and SG specialists (22.7%). The multinomial model was more sensitive than indicator value analysis or abundance-based phi coefficient indices in detecting habitat specialists and also detects generalists statistically. Classification of specialists and generalists based on rarefied subsamples was highly consistent with classification based on the full sample, even for sampling percentages as low as 20%. Major advantages of the new method are (1) its ability to distinguish habitat generalists (species with no significant habitat affinity) from species that are simply too rare to classify and (2) applicability to a single representative sample or a single pooled set of representative samples from each of two habitat types. The method as currently developed can be applied to no more than two habitats at a time.

AB Planting tree seedlings in small patches (islands) has been proposed as a method to facilitate forest recovery that is less expensive than planting large areas and better simulates the nucleation process of recovery. We planted seedlings of four tree species at 12 formerly agricultural sites in southern Costa Rica in two designs: plantation (entire 50 x 50 m area planted) and island (six patches of three sizes). We monitored seedling survival, height, and canopy area over 3 years. To elucidate mechanisms influencing survival and growth, we measured soil and foliar nutrients, soil compaction, and photosynthesis. Survival of all species was similar in the two planting designs. Seedling height and canopy area were greater in plantations than islands at most sites, and more seedlings in islands decreased in height due to damage incurred during plot maintenance. Survival, height, and canopy area were both site- and species-specific with the two N-fixing species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana) greater than the other species (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis). Foliar N was higher in Terminalia and Vochysia in sites where Inga growth was greater. Soil nutrients, however, explained a small amount of the large differences in growth across sites. Leaf mass per area was higher in islands, and P use efficiency was higher in plantations. Our results show advantages (good seedling survival, cheaper) and disadvantages (more seedling damage, slightly lower growth) to the island planting design. Our study highlights the importance of replicating restoration strategies at several sites to make widespread management recommendations.

AB The ability of nonhuman animals to project individual actions into the future is a hotly debated topic. We describe the caching behaviour of tayras (Eira barbara) based on direct observations in the field, pictures from camera traps and radio telemetry, providing evidence that these mustelids pick and cache unripe fruit for future consumption. This is the first reported case of harvesting of unripe fruits by a nonhuman animal. Ripe fruits are readily taken by a variety of animals, and tayras might benefit by securing a food source before strong competition takes place. Unripe climacteric fruits need to be harvested when mature to ensure that they continue their ripening process, and tayras accurately choose mature stages of these fruits for caching.

AB Wetlands in tropical wet-dry climates are governed by distinct and extreme seasonal hydrologic fluctuations. In this study, we investigated the plant community response to seasonal flooding and drought in Palo Verde Marsh, Costa Rica. Climate change models for the region predict reduced rainfall and a drier wet season which would likely alter seasonal hydrologic cycles and prompt vegetation change. We quantified compositional change following disturbance emphasizing seasonal differences in plant life-form abundance across life history stages via standing vegetation, seed bank, and seedling recruitment measurements. Whereas the dry season standing vegetation was dominated by emergent species, aquatic species (floating-rooted, free-floating, and submerged life forms) were more dominant during the wet season. Seed bank and seedling recruitment measurements indicated that many species are resilient with life history traits that enable them to respond rapidly to extreme hydrologic filters. Interestingly, species richness was highest during seasonal flooding. Our results highlight the importance of early-wet season rainfall for plant regeneration and community change. Our findings also indicate that a drier future would likely have a large impact upon wetland plant communities with a decrease in species richness and an increase in the abundance of drought-tolerant emergent species.

AB Tropical forest restoration in Costa Rica: the effect of several strategies on litter production, accumulation and decomposition. Tropical forest restoration strategies have the potential to accelerate the recovery of the nutrient cycles in degraded lands. Litter production and its decomposition represent the main transfer of organic material and nutrients into the soil substrate. We evaluated litter production, accumulation on the forest floor, and its decomposition under three restoration strategies: plantation (entire area planted with trees), island (trees planted in patches of three different sizes) and control (natural regeneration) plots. We also compared restoration strategies to young secondary forest (7-9yr). Restoration treatments were established in 50x50m plots in June 2004 at six sites in Southern Costa Rica. Planted tree species included two native timber species (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) interplanted with two N fixers (Erythrina poeppigiana and Inga edulis). Litter was collected every 15 days between September 2008 and August 2009 in 12 0.25m(2) litter traps distributed within each plot; litter that accumulated on the soil surface was collected at four locations (0.25m(2) quadrats) within each plot in February and May 2009. Total litter production in plantation (6.3Mg/ha) and secondary forest (7.3Mg/ha) did not differ, but were greater than in islands (3.5Mg/ha) and control (1.4Mg/ha). Plantation had greatest accumulation of litter on the soil surface (10.6Mg/ha) as compared to the other treatments (SF=7.2; I=6.7; C=4.9). Secondary forest was the only treatment with a greater annual production of litter than litter accumulation on the soil surface. Carbon storage in litter was similar between plantation and secondary forest, and significantly greater than the other treatments. No differences were found for carbon concentration and storage in the soil among treatments. There was also high variability in the production and accumulation of litter and carbon among sites. Active restoration treatments accelerated the production of litter and carbon storage in comparison to areas under natural recovery. However, the nutrient cycle has not necessarily been restored under these conditions, as high litter accumulation on the soil surface indicates a low decomposition rate, which slows nutrient return to the soil.

AB Terrestrial mammals are a key component of tropical forest communities as indicators of ecosystem health and providers of important ecosystem services. However, there is little quantitative information about how they change with local, regional and global threats. In this paper, the first standardized pantropical forest terrestrial mammal community study, we examine several aspects of terrestrial mammal species and community diversity (species richness, species diversity, evenness, dominance, functional diversity and community structure) at seven sites around the globe using a single standardized camera trapping methodology approach. The sites-located in Uganda, Tanzania, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Suriname, Brazil and Costa Rica-are surrounded by different landscape configurations, from continuous forests to highly fragmented forests. We obtained more than 51 000 images and detected 105 species of mammals with a total sampling effort of 12 687 camera trap days. We find that mammal communities from highly fragmented sites have lower species richness, species diversity, functional diversity and higher dominance when compared with sites in partially fragmented and continuous forest. We emphasize the importance of standardized camera trapping approaches for obtaining baselines for monitoring forest mammal communities so as to adequately understand the effect of global, regional and local threats and appropriately inform conservation actions.

AB Growing demand for food, fuel, and fiber is driving the intensification and expansion of agricultural land through a corresponding displacement of native woodland, savanna, and shrubland. In the wake of this displacement, it is clear that farmland can support biodiversity through preservation of important ecosystem elements at a fine scale. However, how much biodiversity can be sustained and with what tradeoffs for production are open questions. Using a well-studied tropical ecosystem in Costa Rica, we develop an empirically based model for quantifying the "wildlife-friendliness" of farmland for native birds. Some 80% of the 166 mist-netted species depend on fine-scale countryside forest elements (<= 60-m-wide clusters of trees, typically of variable length and width) that weave through farmland along hilltops, valleys, rivers, roads, and property borders. Our model predicts with similar to 75% accuracy the bird community composition of any part of the landscape. We find conservation value in small (<= 20 m wide) clusters of trees and somewhat larger (<= 60 m wide) forest remnants to provide substantial support for biodiversity beyond the borders of tropical forest reserves. Within the study area, forest elements on farms nearly double the effective size of the local forest reserve, providing seminatural habitats for bird species typically associated with the forest. Our findings provide a basis for estimating and sustaining biodiversity in farming systems through managing fine-scale ecosystem elements and, more broadly, informing ecosystem service analyses, biodiversity action plans, and regional land use strategies.

AB Relations between crown width and tree height and trunk diameter and tree height were measured for trees of all sizes of six large emergent species (Balizia elegans, Dipteryx panamensis, Hieronyma alchorneoides, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Lecythis ampla and Terminalia oblonga) in the lowland tropical wet forest at La Selva, Costa Rica. Thirty to 45 individuals were chosen per species to provide a relatively even height distribution from 1 m up to the maximum encountered height. Among small juveniles, the crown widths of the two species with the smallest leaves and horizontally spreading branches were greater than those of the four large-leaved species. On reaching and exceeding the canopy, all but one species showed pronounced increases in crown width with increasing height. These patterns are linked to leaf size and first branching height in small juveniles and low densities of emergent trees at La Selva and other tropical forests, where crown expansion in all directions enhances light interception under the equatorial sun in trees that are not crowded by neighbours of similar height.

AB Sclerocarya birrea ssp. caffra (marula), a typical savanna tree, is vulnerable to the effects of fire, herbivory and their combination. This paper investigated the relative importance of these agents of disturbance, at the level of the individual stem, by specifically focusing on the following questions: (i) What is the greatest cause of mortality in adult marula stems in conservation areas with both elephants and fire? (ii) Does fire interact with bark stripping to cause adult stem mortality and if so what is the dominant mechanism? (iii) At what stem diameter are marulas resistant to fire? Field surveys quantified the extent of damage in marula individuals in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, highlighting the high levels of extreme herbivory such as toppling (7%) and pollarding (8%), relative to bark stripping (only 6% with more than 50% of the circumference stripped). In addition to extreme herbivory, the progression from bark stripping through to invasion of the soft, exposed heartwood by wood borers, often facilitated by fire, through to toppling of the weakened stem after successive fires, appears to be the dominant mechanism by which fire interacts with herbivory to cause adult stem death. Bark stripping and fire manipulation experiments indicated that bark stripping failed to increase the vulnerability of stems to fire directly through transport tissue damage. However, the combination of bark stripping and fire reduced the ability of the stem to regrow bark, increasing the vulnerability of the exposed stem to boring insects and future fires. Fire manipulation experiments were used to identify the minimum stem diameter of resistance to fire. Marula resisted stem death when greater than 3.4 cm in basal diameter. This paper emphasizes the importance of both fire and herbivory in the development of woody plant population structure and by extension, the relative proportion of trees and grasses in savanna landscapes.

AB Most field ecology is conceived and financed by scientists from urban areas but is actually carried out in rural areas. Field staff can either be imported from urban areas or recruited from local residents. We evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of involving rural residents as local technicians over a 25- year period at active field research site in Costa Rica. We defined "local technicians" as local residents with no university education who acquired significant experience in field data collection, data management and/or laboratory work. We analyzed the experiences of incorporating these technicians into field research in developing countries from the points of view of scientist and of the local technicians themselves. Primary data were written responses from to a standardized survey of 19 senior scientists and Ph.D. students, and results from standardized personal interviews with 22 local technicians. Researchers highlighted the advantages of highly-skilled technicians with minimal staff turnover, as well as the technicians' knowledge of local ecological conditions. Local technicians considered the primary advantages of their jobs to be opportunities for continuing education training in science as well as cultural enrichment through interactions with people of different cultures. The main challenges identified by researchers were the lack of long-term funding for projects and extended training required for local technicians. Local technicians can be of great benefit to research projects by providing high-quality data collection at reasonable costs with low staff turnover. Over the last 25 years the research model at the field station we studied has evolved to the point that most long-term projects now depend heavily on local technicians. This model of involving local technicians in long-term research has multiple benefits for the researchers, the technicians and the local community, and could be adapted to a variety of settings in rural areas of developing countries.

AB The phylogenetic structure of communities can reveal forces shaping community assembly, but the vast majority of work on phylogenetic community structure has been conducted in mature ecosystems. Here, we present an analysis of the phylogenetic structure of three Neotropical rain forest communities undergoing succession. In each site, the net relatedness of the community is initially high and consistently declines during succession. This pattern is evident both when comparing plots of different age classes and when comparing stem size classes within each plot: the oldest plots and the youngest stem cohorts. representing the most advanced stages of succession, have the lowest relatedness. Our results suggest that succession leaves a distinct signature in the phylogenetic structure of communities, which may reflect an increasing role of biotic interactions in community assembly during succession. We discuss theoretical explanations for the decline in community phylogenetic relatedness during succession, and suggest directions for future study. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The underrepresentation of women in science has received significant attention. However, there have been few studies in which longitudinal data were used to assess changes over time. Here, we surveyed the Organization for Tropica l Studies graduate database, because this database was also surveyed in 1988, to determine the challenges still faced by women ecologists. Certain aspects of women's situations have shown substantial improvement since 1988, such as an increased number of female colleagues, more-equal sharing of childcare and household chores, and decreased perceptions of gender bias. However, women are still more likely to leave the field of science and have lower salaries, promotion rates, and productivity than do men. Women continue to have greater responsibility for childcare and housework and also experience challenges with childcare and safety while pursuing field-based research. These results indicate that although certain obstacles for women ecologists have substantially lessened, other issues of the family work balance and of fieldwork still need to be addressed.

AB Tropical land cover change has negatively affected numerous migratory bird populations. Forest restoration can augment migrant wintering habitat. However, almost no information exists about factors that influence migrant use of tropical restoration sites. We sampled migrant birds in young restoration sites in Costa Rica from February 2006 to April 2008 to determine how vegetation height, planting design, season, and landscape forest cover influenced capture rates of four declining species. We also documented total numbers of migratory species and individuals captured in each planting design treatment; each site had a control treatment where seedlings were not planted, an island treatment where seedlings were planted in patches, and a plantation treatment where seedlings were planted to cover the entire area. Sites varied in landscape forest cover within 500 m buffers. Three out of four focal species were captured significantly more often in plantation treatments than island or control treatments. Two of the four species showed seasonal patterns and one species was captured more often in high-vegetation sites. Greater numbers of species and individuals were captured in plantation treatments compared to island and control treatments. The plantation planting design increased migrant use more quickly than the island planting design. When resources are available, we recommend planting plantation-style to rapidly increase the value of restoration sites to a range of species, particularly those that use woody vegetation. When resources are more limited, planting islands may be a cost-effective, although not as ecologically effective, alternative that supports a diversity of migrant species compared to unplanted controls.

AB An important question for tropical forest restoration is whether degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds. We censused birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (69-yr old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10-min point counts, we detected a high diversity186 speciesof birds using the restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem densityvegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider: (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure.

AB Prey availability affects many aspects of predators' life history and is considered a primary factor influencing individuals' decisions regarding spatial ecology and behavior, but few experimental data are currently available. Snakes may represent ideal model organisms relative to other animal groups for addressing such resource dependency, due to a presumably more direct link between food resources and many aspects of behavior and natural history. We experimentally investigated the relationship between food intake and spatial behavior in a population of the snake Bothrops asper in a Costa Rican lowland rainforest. Six adult snakes were allowed to forage naturally while six were offered supplemental food in the field, with both groups monitored using radiotelemetry. Mean home range size did not differ between groups presumably due to small sample size, but supplementally fed snakes demonstrated altered patterns of macro- and microhabitat selection, shorter and less frequent movements, and increased mass acquisition. Fed snakes also devoted less time to foraging efforts, instead more frequently remaining inactive and utilizing shelter. Because snakes were always fed in situ and not at designated feeding stations, observed shifts in habitat selection are not explained by animals simply moving to areas of higher food availability. Rather. B. asper may have moved to swamps in order to feed on amphibians when necessary, but remained in preferred forest habitat when food was otherwise abundant. The strong behavioral and spatiotemporal responses of snakes in this population may have been influenced by an overall scarcity of mammalian prey during the study period. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB To gain insight into the ecological processes driving community reassembly in disturbed ecosystems, we assessed the phylogenetic dispersion of early- and late-successional tree species occurring in lowland forests of northeastern Costa Rica. Early-successional species were more closely related than expected by chance, whereas late-successional species tended to be less closely related than expected by chance. Then, we evaluated temporal changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedling and tree assemblages in four 1-ha plots of secondary forests in this region. We found an increase in the phylogenetic evenness among tree individuals over time in all secondary tree assemblages, indicating that relatedness among tree individuals decreases as succession unfolds. This pattern was jointly promoted by recruitment and mortality processes, suggesting that increasing evenness was caused by the replacement of individuals of early-successional species from closely related lineages by late-successional species belonging to a wider diversity of lineages. Based on species occurrence, however, tree community reassembly did not show any significant phylogenetic trend over time. These results suggest that shifts in species abundance over succession have a greater impact on the phylogenetic structure of the community than the turnover of species. Seedling assemblages showed higher phylogenetic evenness than tree assemblages, suggesting that propagule colonization is an important process driving phylogenetic changes in species composition throughout succession. Overall, our findings showed that the phylogenetic structure of these successional communities varies at two temporal scales. At short timescales, decreased dominance by early-successional species over succession leads to increased evenness among tree individuals. At longer timescales, colonization processes result in increased phylogenetic evenness in seedling communities compared to tree communities, forecasting increasing phylogenetic evenness among adult individuals at late-successional stages.

TI Averting biodiversity collapse in tropical forest protected areas

AB The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils global biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon(1-3). With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses(4-9). As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the world's major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve 'health': about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines.

AB Tropical secondary forests form an important part of the landscape. Understanding functional traits of species that colonize at different points in succession can provide insight into community assembly. Although studies on functional traits during forest succession have focused on trees, lianas (woody vines) also contribute strongly to forest biomass, species richness, and dynamics. We examined life history traits of lianas in a forest chronosequence in Costa Rica to determine which traits vary consistently over succession. We conducted 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites. To examine the establishment of young individuals, we only included small lianas (0.51.5 cm diameter at 1.3 m height). For each species, we identified seed size, dispersal mode, climbing mode, and whether or not the seedling is self-supporting. We found a strong axis of variation determined by seed size and seedling growth habit, with early successional communities dominated by small-seeded species with abiotic dispersal and climbing seedlings, while large-seeded, animal-dispersed species with free-standing seedlings increased in abundance with stand age. Contrary to previous research and theory, we found a decrease in the abundance of stem twiners and no decrease in the abundance of tendril-climbers during succession. Seed size appears to be a better indicator of liana successional stage than climbing mode. Liana life history traits change predictably over succession, particularly traits related to seedling establishment. Identifying whether these trait differences persist into the growth strategies of mature lianas is an important research goal, with potential ramifications for understanding the impact of lianas during tropical forest succession.

   PATTERNS
AB Active forest restoration typically involves planting trees over large areas; this practice is costly, however, and establishing homogeneous plantations may favour the recruitment of a particular suite of species and strongly influence the successional trajectory. An alternative approach is to plant nuclei (islands) of trees to simulate the nucleation model of succession and accelerate natural recovery. We evaluated natural tree recruitment over 4years in a restoration study replicated at eight former pasture sites in the tropical premontane forest zone of southern Costa Rica. At each site, two active restoration strategies were established in 50x50m plots: planting trees throughout, and planting different-sized tree islands (4x4, 8x8, 12x12m) within the plot. Restoration plots were compared to similar-sized controls undergoing passive restoration. Sites were spread across c.100km2 and distributed along a gradient of surrounding forest, allowing us to compare the relative importance of adjacent forest to that of within-site treatment on tree recruitment. Recruitment of animal-dispersed tree species was more than twofold higher in active (=0 center dot 45recruitsm2) as compared to passive restoration; recruitment was equivalent in plantation and island treatments, even though only 20% of the area in island plots was planted originally. The majority of recruits (>90%) represented early successional species (n=54 species total). Density of animal-dispersed recruits was greater in large (0 center dot 80 +/- 0 center dot 66m2) than small (0 center dot 28 +/- 0 center dot 36m2) islands and intermediate in medium-sized islands. Seedling recruitment (<1mtall) was greater in the interior of islands as compared to plantations, whereas sapling recruitment was similar, suggesting that island interiors may develop greater density of woody recruits as succession proceeds. Surrounding forest cover did not influence density or species richness of recruits among sites, although this factor may become more important over time. Synthesis and applications. Applied nucleation is a promising restoration strategy that can accelerate forest recovery to a similar degree as plantation-style restoration but is more economical. Appropriate island size is on the order of c.100m2. Practitioners should consider the methodology as an alternative to large-scale plantings.

AB Debate over balancing agricultural production and biodiversity conservation has generated two opposing strategies: a land sparing approach involving large-scale nature reserves, versus a land sharing approach where agricultural areas support wildlife through fine-scale conservation. As a result of this debate, studies focus almost exclusively on species diversity and food production, while ignoring other critical ecosystem processes such as disease dynamics. Here we quantify how tropical avian malaria in an abundant sedentary bird species responds at fine spatial scales in a land sharing system. We find the proportion and configuration of countryside forest elements within a radius of 400 m, proximity to the nearest river, and habitat type explains malaria prevalence across the region. We simulate land sparing and land sharing land use strategies and model malaria prevalence to find that land sharing mitigates malaria prevalence more effectively. With these analyses, we gain a better understanding of how biodiversity, ecosystem services, agricultural yield, and human well-being intersect in complex ecosystems.

AB Male-male competition is recognized as a potent force of sexual selection. When intra-sexual competition is strong then selection theory predicts that alternative male phenotypes will evolve. Circellium bacchus is a large, hornless, ball-rolling dung beetle with extensive variation in size and subject to intense male-male contest competition. We proposed that small male C. bacchus, which are unlikely to be successful in male contest competition, would adopt the alternative reproductive tactic of sneaking copulations. This alternative tactic is likely to influence not only behavior, but morphology with an expectation that sneaking males would invest more resources in testes development. Investigation of testis allometry revealed that smaller male C. bacchus beetles had relatively larger testes than their bigger conspecifics. Furthermore, as resources may be limited during larval development, differential investment in testes development should result in adult male beetles either competing for fertilizations or for access to mates. This is seen in C. bacchus as two alternate male phenotypes; smaller beetles with a relatively low body mass invest proportionately more in testes development compared to larger, heavier form in which testes size does not scale with condition. To our knowledge this study provides the first investigation of alternative phenotypes in the reproductive tactics of a ball-rolling dung beetle species.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare how aquatic macroinvertebrates are affected by certain management practices and agrochemicals in organic and conventional rice cultivations (treatments) in northwestern of Costa Rica. We sampled macroinvertebrates in both treatments, at the water entrances (irrigation) and exits (drainage) during two cycles (8 months total) of rice field cultivation. We employed a water quality index using macroinvertebrates (BMWP/CR) as bioindicators in both management treatments. Insect family mean (P=0.0019) and species mean richness (P=0.0340) were greater in the organic vs. the conventional treatments as well as at the entrances rather than their exits. Both macroinvertebrates mean abundance (P=0.0281) and insects mean abundances (P=0.0065) were greater at the organic vs. the conventional treatments. The water quality index (BMWP/CR) was greater in the organic treatment at the entrance (124) comparing with the exit (72), and also at the conventional entrance (92) vs. the exit (66), thus showing that the management practices affected the macroinvertebrate community. The organic treatment showed the settlement of a greater number of families and species of macroinvertebrates both in general and in those considered sensitive to pollution than in the conventional treatment. This sensitive group of macroinvertebrates (Baetis sp., Fallceon sp., Leptohyphes sp., Tricorythodes sp., Farrodes sp., Phyllogomphoides sp., Hydroptila sp., Mayatrichia sp., Neotrichia sp., Oxyethira sp., Nectopsyche sp.1, Nectopsyche sp.2, Oecetis sp.) can be used as a bioindicators of water quality in these agroecosystems.

AB The abundances and habitat preferences of peccaries in Neotropical forests are important to understand because these keystone species influence many aspects of the ecosystem. In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, we conducted walking surveys for 2 years to study the behavior and population trends of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), and found that peccaries are abundant at La Selva Biological Station and overall, detection rates were relatively constant through time. A stable estimate of detection rates was achieved only after 7-9 months of surveying. We found no habitat preferences between primary and secondary forest, yet there were some differences in group dynamics group radius was larger and sighting distance was greater in primary forest, whereas the number of singletons was higher in secondary forest. More peccaries were seen closer to the laboratory clearing than at greater distances, for a variety of probable reasons: habituation to humans, lower predation and hunting pressure, and various environmental and habitat factors. Peccary groups had spatially clumped distributions across the landscape and were more active diurnally than nocturnally. Collared peccary densities are relatively high at La Selva compared to other Neotropical sites, with the exception of Barro Colorado Island. We combined our data with a review of the historical literature to assess changes in the populations of peccaries in the Caribbean lowlands. We found that collared peccaries have likely increased in abundance at La Selva, seemingly a few years after the extirpation of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecan), which were abundant in the area 40-50 years ago. An understanding of the group dynamics, behavior, and habitat preference of collared peccaries is essential for management decisions and conservation efforts. Additionally, assessment of population changes should be carefully considered in a historical context, with a particular focus on how the populations of the 2 peccary species have changed, and how these species might differentially affect their environment.

AB Many functional properties of forests depend on the leaf area; however, measuring leaf area is not trivial in tall evergreen vegetation. As a result, leaf area is generally estimated indirectly by light absorption methods. These indirect methods are widely used, but have never been calibrated against direct measurements in tropical rain forests, either at point or landscape scales. Here, we compare direct harvest leaf area index (LAI) measurements taken across an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape with data from two indirect methods, digital hemispherical photography and the LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Direct measurements of leaf area were done by collecting all leaf material within an area of 4.6 m(2), extending from the forest floor to the top of the canopy using a portable aluminum scaffolding tower. The tower was erected at 45 locations following a stratified random design.
   Mean direct-harvest LAI above 1 m was 5.5 +/- 03 SE. Plant area index (PAI, leaves + wood) was 5.1 +/- 0.2 for the LAI-2000, and for the hemispherical photographs was 3.9 +/- 0.2, analyzed using Gap Light Analyzer (CIA), and 4.9-6.0 +/- 0.2 using WinSCANOPY software. Correction for leaf clumping (non-random distribution of leaves) generally improved LAI estimates of the hemispherical photographs. At the local scale, direct-harvest LAI was not significantly correlated with LAI estimates for either indirect method. However, correlations between direct-harvest LAI and both indirect methods along vertical canopy transects from forest floor to the canopy top were significant. Relationships between harvest LAI and canopy closure (from which indirect LAI values are derived) showed very small changes in closure with large changes in LAI at LAI values >6, indicating that the estimations of LAI using canopy closure values were reaching an asymptote. As a result, at high canopy closure indirect LAI is underestimated. Overall, the LAI-2000 performed better than hemispherical photography for estimating direct-harvest LAI at landscapes scales. However, with corrections for leaf clumping, hemispherical photography can be effective for estimating and characterizing landscape level LAI of tropical rain forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB To fully understand the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions, information regarding the life history of both immature and adult insect stages is essential. However, most knowledge of plant-herbivore associations is derived from observations of adults. One reason for this bias is that species identification of immature stages is usually challenging. DNA barcodes can be used to identify immature stages to the species level. This technique compares short sequences of the appropriate DNA barcode loci [e.g. mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for insects] of an unidentified specimen with a known DNA barcode library. The accuracy of DNA-based identifications depends on the comprehensiveness of the DNA barcode library. We generated a comprehensive DNA barcode library for a community of rolled-leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in a premontane tropical forest in Costa Rica. The DNA barcode COI accurately identified all beetle species included in the study. Using this DNA barcode library, we identified eggs and larvae of Cephaloleia histrionicaBaly with 100% confidence. This new record of C.histrionica is unique in that this species completes its life cycle on a bromeliad, whereas most Cephaloleia species are associated with plants from the order Zingiberales. The life cycle, diet breadth, immature stages, and sexual dimorphism are described for C.histrionica.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 189-198.

ID REGENERATION
AB In Central America, palm swamps are known collectively as yolillales. These wetlands are usually dominated by the raffia palm Raphia taedigera, but also by the royal palm Manicaria saccifera and -in lower extensions- by the American oil palm Elaeis oleifera. The yolillales tend to be poor in woody species and are characteristic of regions with high rainfall and extensive hydroperiods, so they remain flooded most of the year. The dominance of large raffia palm leaves in the canopy, allow these environments to be distinguishable in aerial photographs, which consequently has helped to map them along most of their distribution. However, while maps depicting yolillales are available, the extent of their surface area, perimeter and connectivity remains poorly understood. This is particularly true for yolillales in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, countries that share a good proportion of palm dominated swaps in the Rio San Juan Basin. In addition, it is not known the actual area of these environments that is under any category of protection according to the conservation systems of both countries. As a first step to catalog yolillal wetlands in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, this paper evaluates cartographic maps to delineate yolillales in the region. A subsample of yolillales mapped in this study were visited and we geo-referenced them and evaluate the extent and condition of the swamp. A total of 110 883.2ha are classified as yolillales in Nicaragua, equivalent to 22% of wetland surface area recorded for that country (excluding the Cocibolca and Xolotan Lakes). In Costa Rica, 53 931.3ha are covered by these palm dominated swamps, which represent 16.24% of the total surface area covered by wetlands. About 47% of the area covered by yolillales in Nicaragua is under some category of protection, the largest extensions protected by Cerro Silva, Laguna Tale Sulumas and Indio Maiz Nature Reserves. In Costa Rica, 55.5% of the area covered by yolillal is located within protected areas, mainly the Tortuguero National Park, Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge and the Sierpe-Terraba National Wetland. Therefore, in both countries, about half the area covered by these wetlands is not protected by their systems of protection of wilderness areas.

AB The herpetofauna that inhabits Caribbean Costa Rica has received considerable attention in the last two decades. This assemblage includes a total of 141 species of reptiles and 95 amphibians mostly distributed in tropical wet and moist lowland forests. While most information available came from primary and secondary forest sites, little is known about the amphibians and reptiles that inhabit more open habitats, such as wetlands and swamps. For instances, swaps dominated by the yolillo palm Raphia taedigera extend through much of the northeastern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and eastern Nicaragua, but information about the herpetological community that uses such environments remains practically unknown. This situation reflects the little research conducted in such inhospitable environments. Here, we report the results of an intensive survey conducted to assess the herpetological community that inhabit R. taedigera palm-swamps. A-total of 14 species of amphibians and 17 of reptiles have been recorded from these swamps. Amphibians and reptiles that inhabit yolillo swamps have wide distributions along much of Middle America and are considered common species throughout their range. In general, yolillo swamps are poor environments for herpetofauna: richness of reptiles and amphibians is almost two times higher in the adjacent forest than in the palm dominated swamps. Furthermore, most species observed in this swamps can be considered habitat generalists that are well adapted to the extreme conditions imposed by the changes in hydroperiods, reduce understory cover, low tree diversity and simple forest architecture of these environments. Despite similarities in the herpetofauna, it is clear that not all forest species use yolillo habitat, a characteristic that is discussed in terms of physical stress driven by the prolonged hydroperiod and reduced leaflitter in the ground, as these features drive habitat structure and herpetofaunal complexity. Our list of species using yolillo swamps is not definitive, and is likely to grow as more studies are conducted in this unexplored environment.

In this paper we analyze camera trap data collected between 2008 and 2012 at a site in Costa Rica (Volcan Barva transect) as part of an ongoing tropical forest global monitoring network (Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network). We estimated occupancy dynamics for 13 species of mammals, using a hierarchical modeling approach. We calculated detection-corrected species richness and the Wildlife Picture Index, a promising new indicator derived from camera trap data that measures changes in biodiversity from the occupancy estimates of individual species. Our results show that 3 out of 13 species showed significant declines in occupancy over 5 years (lowland paca, Central American agouti, nine-banded armadillo). We hypothesize that hunting, competition and/or increased predation for paca and agouti might explain these patterns. Species richness and the Wildlife Picture Index are relatively stable at the site, but small herbivores that are hunted showed a decline in diversity of about 25%. We demonstrate the usefulness of longitudinal camera trap deployments coupled with modern statistical methods and advocate for the use of this approach in monitoring and developing global and national indicators for biodiversity change.

AB Restoring small-scale habitat heterogeneity in highly diverse systems, like tropical forests, is a conservation challenge and offers an excellent opportunity to test factors affecting community assembly. We investigated whether (1) the applied nucleation restoration strategy (planting tree islands) resulted in higher habitat heterogeneity than more homogeneous forest restoration approaches, (2) increased heterogeneity resulted in more diverse tree recruitment, and (3) the mean or coefficient of variation of habitat variables best explained tree recruitment. We measured soil nutrients, overstory and understory vegetation structure, and tree recruitment at six sites with three 5- to 7-year-old restoration treatments: control (no planting), planted tree islands, and conventional, mixed-species tree plantations. Canopy openness and soil base saturation were more variable in island treatments than in controls and plantations, whereas most soil nutrients had similar coefficients of variation across treatments, and bare ground was more variable in control plots. Seedling and sapling species density were equivalent in plantations and islands, and were substantially higher than in controls. Species spatial turnover, diversity, and richness were similar in island and plantation treatments. Mean canopy openness, rather than heterogeneity, explained the largest proportion of variance in species density. Our results show that, whereas canopy openness and soil base saturation are more heterogeneous with the applied nucleation restoration strategy, this pattern does not translate into greater tree diversity. The lack of a heterogeneity-diversity relationship is likely due to the fact that recruits respond more strongly to mean resource gradients than variability at this early stage in succession, and that seed dispersal limitation likely reduces the available species pool. Results show that planting tree islands facilitates tree recruitment to a similar degree as intensive plantation-style restoration strategies.

AB Little is known about moult and moult-site fidelity of African waterfowl. Satellite telemetry and uniquely engraved colour-rings were used to study moult-site fidelity of Egyptian geese marked at two sites in South Africa - Barberspan in the summer-rainfall region and Strandfontein in the winter-rainfall region. Twelve Egyptian geese were tagged with satellite GPS PTT transmitters while moulting at Barberspan and Strandfontein during 2008 and 2009, and a further 527 were colour-ringed between June 2007 and March 2009. Bi-monthly point counts of Egyptian geese and scans for colour-ringed birds were made at each study site from July 2007 until June 2010, resulting in 139 individually colour-ringed geese being re-sighted during the study period. We explored Egyptian geese dispersal distances away from the study sites and modelled moult-site fidelity from colour-ring return rates corrected for survivorship, sampling period efficiency and colour-ring detectability estimates. There were 12% and 29.7% colour-ring return rates for geese ringed at Barberspan and Strandfontein, respectively. Four of five moulting birds tagged at Barberspan with satellite transmitters returned to Barberspan to moult the following year. Two of these same birds moulted at Barberspan in the third year while the other two moulted elsewhere. One out of seven Egyptian geese satellite-tagged at Strandfontein returned to the same site to moult the following year. One bird moulted at a nearby pan (5 km away), two moulted at estuaries less than 30 km from Strandfontein and one bird moulted at a farm dam 56 km away. Two birds satellite-tagged at Strandfontein did not moult the following year and returned to moult at Strandfontein in the third year. The moult-site fidelity model suggested that a minimum of 16% of Barberspan birds and 51% of Strandfontein birds returned to the same wetland to moult the following year. The apparent low moult-site fidelity at Barberspan suggested by colour-ring resightings may reflect the small number of birds colour-ringed at the site.

AB Species are predicted to shift their distributions upslope or poleward in response to global warming. This prediction is supported by a growing number of studies documenting species migrations in temperate systems but remains poorly tested for tropical species, and especially for tropical plant species. We analyzed changes in tree species composition in a network of 10 annually censused 1-ha plots spanning an altitudinal gradient of 70-2800m elevation in Costa Rica. Specifically, we combined plot data with herbarium records (accessed through GBIF) to test if the plots' community temperature scores (CTS, average thermal mean of constituent species weighted by basal area) have increased over the past decade as is predicted by climate-driven species migrations. In addition, we quantified the contributions of stem growth, recruitment, and mortality to the observed patterns. Supporting our a priori hypothesis of upward species migrations, we found that there have been consistent directional shifts in the composition of the plots, such that the relative abundance of lowland species, and hence CTS, increased in 90% of plots. The rate of the observed compositional shifts corresponds to a mean thermal migration rate (TMR) of 0.0065 degrees Cyr(-1) (95% CI=0.0005-0.0132 degrees Cyr(-1)). While the overall TMR is slower than predicted based on concurrent regional warming of 0.0167 degrees Cyr(-1), migrations were on pace with warming in 4 of the 10 plots. The observed shifts in composition were driven primarily by mortality events (i.e., the disproportionate death of highland vs. lowland species), suggesting that individuals of many tropical tree species will not be able to tolerate future warming and thus their persistence in the face of climate change will depend on successful migrations. Unfortunately, in Costa Rica and elsewhere, land area inevitably decreases at higher elevations; hence, even species that are able to migrate successfully will face heightened risks of extinction.

AB Artificial roosts have been proposed as a tool for augmenting bat populations and catalyzing tropical forest regeneration. In the best case scenario, roosts would attract seed-carrying bats (Family Phyllostomidae) into degraded pastures and form nucleating patches of native vegetation. We tested this scenario by monitoring 48 artificial roosts in pastures and adjacent forest fragments in southern Costa Rica over 2 years. Half of the pasture roosts were exposed to direct sunlight and half were affixed to 4-m living stakes of Erythrina poeppigiana (Walp.) O.F. Cook that provided shade. After 2 years, 94% of roosts in forest and 40% of roosts in pasture had been used by bats at least once - primarily for nocturnal feeding. Maximum daily temperature inside of roosts was the best microclimatic predictor of bat visitation. We identified at least five species of bats that visited roosts, including two frugivores (Carollia and Glossophaga spp.). Bat-mediated seed dispersal increased with the number of frugivorous bat detections at roosts, but seedling recruitment did not increase with either bat detections or seed abundance over a 2-year period. Given that bats rarely used roosts in pastures, and bat visitation did not increase seedling recruitment, our data suggest that artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned, premontane pastures in southern Costa Rica. This method could be refined by investigating alternative roost designs, barriers to seedling recruitment below roosts, improvement of roost microclimatic conditions in pastures, and ability of bats to detect roosts in different habitats.

AB Metaphors are common in our ecological and conservation language. They help us understand complex issues and communicate them to different audiences. We propose two new metaphors: ecosystem leaks and ecosystem clogs that can help us understand the role of flows among ecosystems ( inflows and outflows), the impacts of anthropogenic perturbations of these flows within and beyond ecosystem boundaries. They help us grasp the need for a broader outlook in restoration and conservation that goes beyond the ecosystem level. We define an ecosystem leak as any net loss of natural capital from any ecosystem with the potential of exerting a long-term transformative effect. As its name implies, an ecosystem clog is the opposite of a leak, and we define it as a total or partial obstruction in the flows of natural capital within an ecosystem, or between ecosystems. Leaks can create clogs, and vice versa, and they can occur in cyclic succession causing cascading effects that affect not just the natural capital of an ecosystem, but its social and cultural capital as well. We focus on anthropogenic leaks and clogs as these are the ones for which society does not invest adequate attention and efforts.

AB The ability to assess and avoid predation risk is thought to be a major determinant of behavior for small mammals. We assessed the antipredator responses of three Neotropical rodent species (Heteromys desmarestianus, Peromyscus mexicanus and Melanomys caliginosus) to cues (feces or actual presence) of the snake Bothrops asper. We investigated whether rodents avoided entering or spent less time in snake-cued areas using an experimental arena, and whether rodents reduced foraging efforts (measured by giving-up density) in snake-cued areas under laboratory, semi-natural and field conditions. P.mexicanus and M.caliginosus did not demonstrate any snake avoidance, and did not reduce foraging efforts under any conditions. H.desmarestianus significantly avoided live snakes only at very short distances (<20cm), and reduced foraging efforts in the presence of snakes only under certain experimental conditions. These results are in contrast to many studies demonstrating antipredator behavior by small mammals in temperate and desert ecosystems in response to cues of predators, including snakes, and were influenced by overall low statistical power. This discrepancy may also be explained by the complexity of tropical forest systems, as rodents must assess a myriad of sensory cues and balance risk from multiple predator groups that require different avoidance strategies. An ambush-hunting snake such as B.asper may also face strong selective pressure to avoid detection by its mammalian prey.

AB Many organisms use chemical defenses to reduce predation risk. Aposematic dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid-based chemical defenses from a diet of arthropods, but research on these defenses has been limited to adults. Herein, we investigate chemical defense across development in a dendrobatid frog, Oophaga pumilio. This species displays complex parental care: at hatching, mothers transport tadpoles to phytotelmata, and then return to supply them with an obligate diet of nutritive eggs for about six weeks. We collected eggs, tadpoles, juveniles, and adults of O. pumilio, and detected alkaloids in all life stages. The quantity and number of alkaloids increased with frog and tadpole size. We did not detect alkaloids in the earliest stage of tadpoles, but alkaloids were detected as trace quantities in nutritive eggs and as small quantities in ovarian eggs. Tadpoles hand-reared with eggs of an alkaloid-free heterospecific frog did not contain alkaloids. Alkaloids that are sequestered from terrestrial arthropods were detected in both adults and phytotelm-dwelling tadpoles that feed solely on nutritive eggs, suggesting that this frog may be the first animal known to actively provision post-hatch offspring with chemical defenses. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that maternally derived alkaloids deter predation of tadpoles by a predatory arthropod.

AB Birds both promote and prosper from forest restoration. The ecosystem functions birds perform can increase the pace of forest regeneration and, correspondingly, increase the available habitat for birds and other forest-dependent species. The aim of this study was to learn how tropical forest restoration treatments interact with landscape tree cover to affect the structure and composition of a diverse bird assemblage. We sampled bird communities over two years in 13 restoration sites and two old-growth forests in southern Costa Rica. Restoration sites were established on degraded farmlands in a variety of landscape contexts, and each included a 0.25-ha plantation, island treatment (trees planted in patches), and unplanted control. We analyzed four attributes of bird communities including frugivore abundance, nectarivore abundance, migrant insectivore richness, and compositional similarity of bird communities in restoration plots to bird communities in old-growth forests. All four bird community variables were greater in plantations and/or islands than in control treatments. Frugivore and nectarivore abundance decreased with increasing tree cover in the landscape surrounding restoration plots, whereas compositional similarity to old-growth forests was greatest in plantations embedded in landscapes with high tree cover. Migrant insectivore richness was unaffected by landscape tree cover. Our results agree with previous studies showing that increasing levels of investment in active restoration are positively related to bird richness and abundance, but differences in the effects of landscape tree cover on foraging guilds and community composition suggest that trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and bird-mediated ecosystem functioning may be important for prioritizing restoration sites.

AB An analysis of the planform changes of the Colombian reach of the Amazon River was carried out over a period of 19.9 years. Remote sensing image processing techniques were applied to Landsat images acquired in 1986, 1994, 2001 and, 2006. These images were selected based on minimal daily water level variations, while providing the widest temporal span. Plan view river changes and geomorphologic characteristics were examined to identify which channel pattern classification best represents this large tropical river system. Discharge was also analyzed to determine whether changes in the river's plan view are a direct response to variations in discharge. The system had a depositional tendency between 1986 and 2006, with a period where erosion was more intense than deposition between 1994 and 2001. Percent change in the plan view area of the system (1.4% yr(-1)) and the maximum migration rates (125 m yr(-1)) suggest that this reach of the Amazon is less active than reaches upstream and the downstream reach between the confluences of the Jutai and Japura Rivers. Variations in discharge appear to be responsible for deposition and erosion dynamics observed after this remote sensing analysis in the Colombian reach of the Amazon River. Characteristics including multiple channels with vegetated islands developed from within-channel deposition, meandering planform, lateral activity of channel margins, and the absence of islands with saucer-like morphology suggest a multichannel, meandering pattern for this reach of the Amazon, that corresponds to a laterally active anabranching river.

AB Secondary forests comprise an increasing area of the tropics and play an important role in global carbon cycling. We compare above-ground biomass accumulation of both planted and naturally regenerating trees, as well as C in the top soil layer, in three restoration treatments replicated at 14, six to eight year old restoration sites in southern Costa Rica. Restoration strategies include: control (no planting), planting tree islands, and conventional, mixed-species tree plantations. We evaluate the importance of past land-use, soil nutrients, understory cover, and surrounding forest cover in explaining variation in above-ground biomass accumulation (ABA) rate across sites. Total ABA and planted tree ABA rate were highest in plantations, intermediate in islands, and lowest in control treatments, whereas ABA rate of naturally regenerating trees did not differ across treatments. Most ABA in plantations (89%) and islands (70%) was due to growth of planted trees. Soil carbon did not change significantly over the time period of the study in any treatment. The majority of across-site variation in both total and planted tree ABA rate was explained by duration of prior pasture use. Tree growth in the first two years after planting explained approximately two-thirds of the variation in ABA rate after 6-8 years. Soil nutrient concentrations explained relatively little of the variation in planted or naturally recruiting ABA rate. Our results show that planting trees substantially increases biomass accumulation during the first several years of forest recovery in former agricultural lands and that past-land use has a strong effect on the rate of biomass accumulation. Planting tree islands is a cost-effective strategy for increasing ABA and creating more heterogeneous habitat conditions than tree plantations. We recommend small scale planting trials to quickly assess potential biomass accumulation and prioritize sites for ecosystem service payments for carbon sequestration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We document a facultative Bartonella-like Rhizobiales bacterium in the giant tropical ant, Paraponera clavata. In a lowland tropical rainforest in Costa Rica, 59 colonies were assayed for the prevalence of the Bartonella-like bacterium (BLB), 14 of which were positive. We addressed three questions: First, how does the prevalence of BLB within colonies vary with environmental conditions? Second, how does diet affect the prevalence of BLB in P. clavata? Third, how does the distribution of BLB among colonies reflect ambient differences in food resources and foraging habits? A variety of environmental variables that may be predictive of the presence of BLB were measured, and diet manipulations were conducted to test whether the prevalence of BLB responded to supplemental carbohydrate or prey. The ambient frequency of BLB is much higher in young secondary forests, but is nearly absent from older secondary forests. The prevalence of BLB inside field colonies increased over the duration of a 2-week carbohydrate supplementation; however, water and prey supplementation did not alter the prevalence of BLB. The diets of the colonies located in young secondary forest, compared to other habitats, have a diet richer in carbohydrates and lower in prey. The abundance of carbohydrate, or the relative lack of N, in a colony's diet influences the occurrence of the BLB microbe in P. clavata. As experimental diet manipulations can affect the facultative presence of an N-cycling microbe, a consistent diet shift in diet may facilitate the emergence of tighter symbioses.

ID BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; SCIENCE; MANAGEMENT; POLICY
AB Restoration practitioners adopt a multiplicity of approaches that range from basic trial and error, and site-specific efforts, to complex experimental designs that test cutting edge theoretical hypotheses. We classify these different strategies to understand how restoration is planned and executed, and to contribute to the discussion on certification and evaluation. We use Aldo Leopold's notion of intelligent tinkering as a basis for a typology of four different approaches to restoration based on four parameters: motivation, general strategy, method of inquiry, and temporal and spatial scales of the expected outcomes. We argue that efforts to restore a damaged ecosystem in a skilled and experimental manner should be called professional intelligent tinkering versus amateur intelligent tinkering, and careless tinkering. We compare these three types of tinkering, and a more formal scientific approach. In professional intelligent tinkering, interventions and adjustments are done in a logical and careful manner, and with a methodical, experimental mindset. In contrast to the scientific approach, intelligent tinkering does not necessarily follow a formal experimental procedure, with replications and controls that allow extrapolation, nor is it driven by the motivation to publish in peer-reviewed journals. Rather, it is primarily driven by a desire to solve site-specific problems even in the absence of sufficient ecological knowledge to apply previously tested knowledge and techniques. We illustrate three approaches with three on-going restoration projects in southeastern Brazil, two of which are small scale, and one of which is very large scale.

AB The first few years of tropical forest restoration can be expensive, especially when applied to expansive areas. In light of this, passive restoration has been recommended as a considerably cheaper or even free alternative. There are, however, both direct and indirect costs associated with passive restoration. First, the longer recovery time that is typically required in passive restoration can be perceived as project failure, especially when compared with nearby active restoration efforts. In the worst-case scenario, this can lead to the premature termination of a project by a landowner who would like to see more rapid or visible results. Second, passive restoration may be viewed as land abandonment, and in developing nations where land tenure is not always strictly enforced this may invite unanticipated uses, such as ranchers who may unintentionally or intentionally allow livestock to take advantage of the unused forage grass, thus setting back recovery efforts. Lastly, passive restoration does have direct financial costs, including material costs for establishing fences and repairing them, and labor costs for site vigilance. These upfront investments may need to be made repeatedly in passive restoration efforts, and for a longer time period than for an active restoration project. Both the direct and indirect costs should be considered prior to choosing passive restoration as a strategy in a particular restoration project.

AB Parents defend their young in many ways, including provisioning chemical defences. Recent work in a poison frog system offers the first example of an animal that provisions its young with alkaloids after hatching or birth rather than before. But it is not yet known whether maternally derived alkaloids are an effective defence against offspring predators. We identified the predators of Oophaga pumilio tadpoles and conducted laboratory and field choice tests to determine whether predators are deterred by alkaloids in tadpoles. We found that snakes, spiders and beetle larvae are common predators of O. pumilio tadpoles. Snakes were not deterred by alkaloids in tadpoles. However, spiders were less likely to consume mother-fed O. pumilio tadpoles than either alkaloid-free tadpoles of the red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, or alkaloid-free O. pumilio tadpoles that had been hand-fed with A. callidryas eggs. Thus, maternally derived alkaloids reduce the risk of predation for tadpoles, but only against some predators.

AB Aims: Bark thickness-stem diameter relationships are non-linear above a stem diameter threshold in many woody species, which makes relative bark thickness measures dependent on the range of stem diameters that are sampled. This influences the appropriateness of different methods for comparing fire responses of woody plants across studies. Here we develop a framework for bark thickness comparisons by evaluating relative bark thickness estimates and bark thickness predictions obtained from linear and curved models fitted to raw and log-transformed bark-stem data. We use this framework to contrast bark thickness among fynbos and savanna plant functional groups.
   Location: Fynbos (17 species) and savanna (21 species) systems in South Africa.
   Methods: The linear subset of bark-stem data was identified using a three-step procedure. Linear regressions (with and without an intercept) and curved models (allometric and modified exponential models) were fitted to the linear subset and complete raw bark-stem data set, respectively. In addition, linear regression models were fitted to the log-transformed complete bark-stem data set. Regression slopes and bark thickness predictions obtained from these different approaches were compared, to determine which method provides the most robust metric for comparing bark thickness. Bark thickness was compared among fynbos resprouter guilds and acacias from low- and high-fire savannas.
   Results: The slope of the regression model fitted to the linear subset of raw bark-stem data provides a reliable metric for general comparisons of relative bark thickness. Bark thickness predictions from the curved and log models were comparable at 20-cm stem diameter, but the log model underestimated bark thickness at 5 cm for certain species. Relative bark thickness was significantly higher in: (1) fynbos fire resisters and epicormic resprouters than in non-resprouters; and (2) acacias from high- vs low-fire savannas.
   Conclusions: The slope of the regression model fitted to the linear subset of raw bark-stem data is a useful metric for bark thickness comparisons across studies, and compares favourably with bark thickness predictions derived from models fitted to the complete bark-stem data set. Fynbos and savanna trends support the proposition that relative bark thickness reflects differences in woody plant responses to fire and indicate the modal fire regime of ecosystems.

AB The 'novel ecosystem' concept has captured the attention of scientists, managers, and science journalists, and more recently of policymakers, before it has been subjected to the scrutiny and empirical validation inherent to science. Lack of rigorous scrutiny can lead to undesirable outcomes in ecosystem management, environmental law, and policy. Contrary to the contentions of its proponents, no explicit, irreversible ecological thresholds allow distinctions between 'novel ecosystems' and 'hybrid' or 'historic' ones. Further, there is no clear message as to what practitioners should do with a 'novel ecosystem'. In addition, ecosystems of many types are being conserved, or restored to trajectories within historical ranges of variation, despite severe degradation that could have led to their being pronounced 'novel'.

AB Exploring the relationship between phenotype and performance in an ecological and evolutionary context is crucial to understanding the adaptive nature of phenotypic traits. Despite their ubiquity in vertebrates, few studies have examined the functional and ecological significance of claw morphologies. Here we examine the adhesive toepad and claw system of Anolis lizards. Claw characters are significantly different between lizards classified as arboreal (perch height >= 1 m) and non-arboreal (perch height <1 m). Arboreal species possess significantly higher and longer claws, and show trends toward decreased claw curvature and wider claw tip angles. Toepad size and claw length and height are tightly correlated with each other and with perch height, suggesting that the adhesive toepad and gripping claw have co-evolved to accommodate different habitats. The functional morphology and evolution of claws are ripe areas for future investigation. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Species of yeasts and other microfungi carried by pollinators are of general ecological interest because some of these microbial species can grow in floral nectar and affect plant-pollinator interactions. It is, however, not well understood how the composition of fungal species found on pollinators varies over space or time. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns in the microfungi found on the bills of hummingbirds and in the mouths of nectarivorous bats was investigated along a gradient of deforestation within a Costa Rican countryside landscape. The community composition of microfungi found on hummingbirds' bills and bats' mouths underwent substantial compositional turnover over a 2-month period and between 2 yr. In contrast, fungal community composition was not significantly correlated with spatial distance, habitat type, species of hummingbirds, nor the forest dependency of the hummingbirds sampled for microfungi. These findings suggest that, in this landscape, fungal communities on a nectarivous vertebrate vector might be influenced primarily by temporal factors such as plant and flower phenology rather than spatial environmental heterogeneity.

AB As tropical forests respond to environmental change, autotrophic respiration may consume a greater proportion of carbon fixed in photosynthesis at the expense of growth, potentially turning the forests into a carbon source. Predicting such a response requires that we measure and place autotrophic respiration in a complete carbon budget, but extrapolating measurements of autotrophic respiration from chambers to ecosystem remains a challenge. High plant species diversity and complex canopy structure may cause respiration rates to vary and measurements that do not account for this complexity may introduce bias in extrapolation more detrimental than uncertainty. Using experimental plantations of four native tree species with two canopy layers, we examined whether species and canopy layers vary in foliar respiration and wood CO2 efflux and whether the variation relates to commonly used scalars of mass, nitrogen (N), photosynthetic capacity and wood size. Foliar respiration rate varied threefold between canopy layers, similar to 0.74 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the overstory and similar to 0.25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the understory, but little among species. Leaf mass per area, N and photosynthetic capacity explained some of the variation, but height explained more. Chamber measurements of foliar respiration thus can be extrapolated to the canopy with rates and leaf area specific to each canopy layer or height class. If area-based rates are sampled across canopy layers, the area-based rate may be regressed against leaf mass per area to derive the slope (per mass rate) to extrapolate to the canopy using the total leaf mass. Wood CO2 efflux varied 1.0-1.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for overstory trees and 0.6-0.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for understory species. The variation in wood CO2 efflux rate was mostly related to wood size, and little to species, canopy layer or height. Mean wood CO2 efflux rate per surface area, derived by regressing CO2 efflux per mass against the ratio of surface area to mass, can be extrapolated to the stand using total wood surface area. The temperature response of foliar respiration was similar for three of the four species, and wood CO2 efflux was similar between wet and dry seasons. For these species and this forest, vertical sampling may yield more accurate estimates than would temporal sampling.

AB Rapid biological changes are expected to occur on tropical elevational gradients as species migrate upslope or go extinct in the face of global warming. We established a series of 9 1-ha plots in old-growth tropical rainforest in Costa Rica along a 2700 m relief elevational gradient to carry out long-term monitoring of tropical rain forest structure, dynamics and tree growth. Within each plot we mapped, identified, and annually measured diameter for all woody individuals with stem diameters >10 cm for periods of 3-10 years. Wood species diversity peaked at 400-600 m and decreased substantially at higher elevations. Basal area and stem number varied by less than two-fold, with the exception of the 2800 m cloud forest summit, where basal area and stem number were approximately double that of lower sites. Canopy gaps extending to the forest floor accounted for <3% of microsites at all elevations. Height of highest crowns and the coefficient of variation of crown height both decreased with increasing elevation. Rates of turnover of individuals and of stand basal area decreased with elevation, but rates of diameter growth and stand basal area showed no simple relation to elevation. We discuss issues encountered in the design and implementation of this network of plots, including biased sampling, missing key meteorological and biomass data, and strategies for improving species-level research. Taking full advantage of the major research potential of tropical forest elevational transects will require sustaining and extending ground based studies, incorporation of new remotely-sensed data and data-acquisition platforms, and new funding models to support decadal research on these rapidly-changing systems.

AB Large areas of tropical lands are being removed from agriculture and restored to address conservation goals. However, monitoring the ecological value of these efforts at the individual land-owner scale is rare, owing largely to issues of cost and accessibility. Traditional field-based measures for assessing forest recovery and habitat quality can be labour intensive and costly. Here we assess whether remote sensing measurements from lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a cost-effective substitute for traditional field measures. An inexpensive UAV-based remote sensing methodology, "Ecosynth", was applied to measure forest canopy structure across field plots in a 7-9-yr tropical forest restoration study in southern Costa Rica. Ecosynth methods combine aerial images from consumer-grade digital cameras with computer vision software to generate 3D 'point cloud' models of vegetation at high spatial resolutions. Ecosynth canopy structure measurements were compared to field-based measures and their ability to predict the abundance of frugivorous birds; key seed dispersers that are sensitive to canopy structure. Ecosynth canopy height measurements were highly correlated with field-based measurements (R-2 >= 0.85), a result comparable in precision to LiDAR-based remote sensing measurements. Ecosynth parameters were also strongly correlated with above-ground biomass (R-2 >= 0.81) and percent canopy openness (R-2 = 0.82). Correlations were weaker with proportion-based measures such as canopy roughness (R-2 = 0.53). Several Ecosynth metrics (e.g., canopy openness and height) predicted frugivore presence and abundance at levels of accuracy similar to those of field-based measurements. Ecosynth UAV remote-sensing provides an effective alternate methodology to traditional field-based measures of evaluating forest structure and complexity across landscapes. Furthermore, given the volume of data that can be generated in a single flight plan, as well as the ability to use the technology in remote areas, these methods could expand the scope of studies on forest dynamics and recovery when combined with field-based calibration plots.

   LANDSCAPE; APPLIED NUCLEATION; ATLANTIC FOREST; CENTRAL PANAMA
AB Past studies have shown that tropical forest regeneration on degraded farmlands is initially limited by lack of seed dispersal, but few studies have tracked changes in abundance and composition of seed rain past the first few years after land abandonment. We measured seed rain for 12 months in 10 6-9-year-old restoration sites and five mature, reference forests in southern Costa Rica in order to learn (1) if seed rain limitation persists past the first few years of regeneration; (2) how restoration treatments influence seed community structure and composition; and (3) whether seed rain limitation is contingent on landscape context. Each restoration site contained three 0.25-ha treatment plots: (1) a naturally regenerating control, (2) tree islands, and (3) a mixed-species tree plantation. Sites spanned a deforestation gradient with 9-89% forest area within 500 m around the treatment plots. Contrary to previous studies, we found that tree seeds were abundant and ubiquitous across all treatment plots (585.1 +/- 142.0 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1) [mean +/- SE]), indicating that lack of seed rain ceased to limit forest regeneration within the first decade of recovery. Pioneer trees and shrubs comprised the vast majority of seeds, but compositional differences between restoration sites and reference forests were driven by rarer, large-seeded species. Large, animal-dispersed tree seeds were more abundant in tree islands (4.6 +/- 2.9 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)) and plantations (5.8 +/- 3.0 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)) than control plots (0.2 +/- 0.1 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)), contributing to greater tree species richness in actively restored plots. Planted tree species accounted for <1% of seeds. We found little evidence for landscape forest cover effects on seed rain, consistent with previous studies. We conclude that seed rain limitation shifted from an initial, complete lack of tree seeds to a specific limitation on large-seeded, mature forest species over the first decade. Although total seed abundance was equal among restoration treatments, tree plantations and tree islands continued to diversify seed rain communities compared to naturally regenerating controls. Compositional differences between regenerating plots and mature forests suggest that large-seeded tree species are appropriate candidates for enrichment planting.

AB On the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, rainfall patterns and clay-rich soils allow the development of extensive wetlands. These environments constitute unique habitats for the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity and provide significant ecological services to the surrounding seasonal dry forest. Despite these benefits, wetlands have been severely reduced in the last four decades, and little information is available on their biology and current conservation status. Here, we describe the main limnological traits of 30 sites representing different types of wetlands from four distinct physiographic regions: Tempisque River Lower Basin; Tempisque River Middle Basin; Delta del Estero Real River; and the Oriental Region of Nicaragua. At each site, samples were taken at the beginning (infilling phase), middle (maximum flooded areas) and end (desiccation phase) of the 2010 hydrological cycle. We analysed a set of water parameters (depth, temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, major ions and nutrient concentrations) and biological parameters (shoreline vegetation, chlorophyll a, macrophyte cover) and assessed the conservation status of wetlands using the Index of the State of Conservation of Shallow Lentic Ecosystems (ECELS). In most sites, the water was relatively clear with near basic pH-values, low conductivity, and low levels of dissolved oxygen, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates and sulphates. Chlorophyll a and alkalinity varied through the season and among regions. Ion concentrations were generally low in most wetlands except for those close to estuarine and marine coastal areas. A total of 49 taxa of aquatic plants were found in the study sites, the most common being the emergent Typha domingensis and Thalia geniculata, and the floating Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia crassipes. Wetlands within the same region exhibited great similarity in their aquatic plant communities but not necessarily in their physicochemical attributes. According to the ECELS index, wetlands could be ranked from medium to good quality, although most of them are threatened by anthropogenic impacts, including those protected at Delta del Estero Real Nature Reserve (Nicaragua) and Palo Verde National Park (Costa Rica).

AB The high species richness of tropical forests has long been recognized, yet there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the actual number of tropical tree species. Using a pantropical tree inventory database from closed canopy forests, consisting of 657,630 trees belonging to 11,371 species, we use a fitted value of Fisher's alpha and an approximate pantropical stem total to estimate the minimum number of tropical forest tree species to fall between similar to 40,000 and similar to 53,000, i.e., at the high end of previous estimates. Contrary to common assumption, the Indo-Pacific region was found to be as species-rich as the Neotropics, with both regions having a minimum of similar to 19,000-25,000 tree species. Continental Africa is relatively depauperate with a minimum of similar to 4,500-6,000 tree species. Very few species are shared among the African, American, and the Indo-Pacific regions. We provide a methodological framework for estimating species richness in trees that may help refine species richness estimates of tree-dependent taxa.

TI Globally, functional traits are weak predictors of juvenile tree growth,

AB Plant functional traits, in particular specific leaf area (SLA), wood density and seed mass, are often good predictors of individual tree growth rates within communities. Individuals and species with high SLA, low wood density and small seeds tend to have faster growth rates. If community-level relationships between traits and growth have general predictive value, then similar relationships should also be observed in analyses that integrate across taxa, biogeographic regions and environments. Such global consistency would imply that traits could serve as valuable proxies for the complex suite of factors that determine growth rate, and, therefore, could underpin a new generation of robust dynamic vegetation models. Alternatively, growth rates may depend more strongly on the local environment or growth-trait relationships may vary along environmental gradients. We tested these alternative hypotheses using data on 27352 juvenile trees, representing 278 species from 27 sites on all forested continents, and extensive functional trait data, 38% of which were obtained at the same sites at which growth was assessed. Data on potential evapotranspiration (PET), which summarizes the joint ecological effects of temperature and precipitation, were obtained from a global data base. We estimated size-standardized relative height growth rates (SGR) for all species, then related them to functional traits and PET using mixed-effect models for the fastest growing species and for all species together. Both the mean and 95th percentile SGR were more strongly associated with functional traits than with PET. PET was unrelated to SGR at the global scale. SGR increased with increasing SLA and decreased with increasing wood density and seed mass, but these traits explained only 3.1% of the variation in SGR. SGR-trait relationships were consistently weak across families and biogeographic zones, and over a range of tree statures. Thus, the most widely studied functional traits in plant ecology were poor predictors of tree growth over large scales.Synthesis. We conclude that these functional traits alone may be unsuitable for predicting growth of trees over broad scales. Determining the functional traits that predict vital rates under specific environmental conditions may generate more insight than a monolithic global relationship can offer.

DE active restoration; natural regeneration; restoration costs
AB We agree with Prach and del Moral that passive recovery is often a desirable and effective restoration strategy. Passive and various active restoration approaches need to be weighed on a case-by-case basis and depend on the goals, relative rates of recovery desired, and various social and financial costs implicit in each option. That said, we stress that passive restoration has a unique set of challenges and costs, which we highlighted in our original article and briefly reiterate here.

AB Grazing lawns are a distinct grassland community type, characterised by short-stature and with their persistence and spread promoted by grazing. In Africa, they reveal a long co-evolutionary history of grasses and large mammal grazers. The attractiveness to grazers of a low-biomass sward lies in the relatively high quality of forage, largely due to the low proportion of stem material in the sward; this encourages repeat grazing that concomitantly suppresses tall-grass growth forms that would otherwise outcompete lawn species for light. Regular grazing that prevents shading and maintains sward quality is thus the cornerstone of grazing lawn dynamics. The strong interplay between abiotic conditions and disturbance factors, which are central to grazing lawn existence, can also cause these systems to be highly dynamic. Here we identify differences in growth form among grazing lawn grass species, and assess how compositional differences among lawn types, as well as environmental variables, influence their maintenance requirements (i.e. grazing frequency) and vulnerability to degradation. We also make a clear distinction between the processes of lawn establishment and lawn maintenance. Rainfall, soil nutrient status, grazer community composition and fire regime have strong and interactive influences on both processes. However, factors that concentrate grazing pressure (e.g. nutrient hotspots and sodic sites) have more bearing on where lawns establish. Similarly, we discuss the relevance of enhanced rates of nitrogen cycling and of sodium levels to lawn maintenance. Grazer community composition and density has considerable significance to grazing lawn dynamics; not all grazers are adapted to foraging on short-grass swards, and differences in body size and relative mouth dimensions determine which species are able to convert tall-grass swards into grazing lawns under different conditions. Hence, we evaluate the roles of different grazers in lawn dynamics, as well as the benefits that grazer populations derive from having access to grazing lawns. The effects of grazing lawns can extend well beyond their borders, due to their influence on grazer densities, behaviour and movements as well as fire spread, intensity and frequency. Variation in the area and proportion of a landscape that is grazing lawn can thus have a profound impact on system dynamics. We provide a conceptual model that summarises grazing lawn dynamics, and identify a rainfall range where we predict grazing lawns to be most prevalent. We also examine the biodiversity associated with grazing lawn systems, and consider their functional contribution to the conservation of this biodiversity. Finally, we assess the utility of grazing lawns as a resource in a rangeland context.

AB Serpocaulon xrojasianum, a new hybrid, is described and illustrated from Costa Rica. It was found growing with its two parents, S. dissimile and S. triseriale, and is intermediate between them in many morphological characters. The spores are malformed and presumably non-viable, but occasionally large, globose, apparently unreduced spores are found. This is the fifth hybrid reported for the genus.

AB Successional gradients are ubiquitous in nature, yet few studies have systematically examined the evolutionary origins of taxa that specialize at different successional stages. Here we quantify successional habitat specialization in Neotropical forest trees and evaluate its evolutionary lability along a precipitation gradient. Theoretically, successional habitat specialization should be more evolutionarily conserved in wet forests than in dry forests due to more extreme microenvironmental differentiation between early and late-successional stages in wet forest. We applied a robust multinomial classification model to samples of primary and secondary forest trees from 14 Neotropical lowland forest sites spanning a precipitation gradient from 788 to 4000mm annual rainfall, identifying species that are old-growth specialists and secondary forest specialists in each site. We constructed phylogenies for the classified taxa at each site and for the entire set of classified taxa and tested whether successional habitat specialization is phylogenetically conserved. We further investigated differences in the functional traits of species specializing in secondary vs. old-growth forest along the precipitation gradient, expecting different trait associations with secondary forest specialists in wet vs. dry forests since water availability is more limiting in dry forests and light availability more limiting in wet forests. Successional habitat specialization is non-randomly distributed in the angiosperm phylogeny, with a tendency towards phylogenetic conservatism overall and a trend towards stronger conservatism in wet forests than in dry forests. However, the specialists come from all the major branches of the angiosperm phylogeny, and very few functional traits showed any consistent relationships with successional habitat specialization in either wet or dry forests.Synthesis. The niche conservatism evident in the habitat specialization of Neotropical trees suggests a role for radiation into different successional habitats in the evolution of species-rich genera, though the diversity of functional traits that lead to success in different successional habitats complicates analyses at the community scale. Examining the distribution of particular lineages with respect to successional gradients may provide more insight into the role of successional habitat specialization in the evolution of species-rich taxa.

AB Neotropical fruit bats (family Phyllostomidae) facilitate forest regeneration on degraded lands by dispersing shrub and tree seeds. Accordingly, if fruit bats can be attracted to restoration sites, seed dispersal could be enhanced. We surveyed bat communities at 10 sites in southern Costa Rica to evaluate whether restoration treatments attracted more fruit bats if trees were planted on degraded farmlands in plantations or island configurations versus natural regeneration. We also compared the relative influence of tree cover at local and landscape spatial scales on bat abundances. We captured 68% more fruit bat individuals in tree plantations as in controls, whereas tree island plots were intermediate. Bat activity also responded to landscape tree cover within a 200-m radius of restoration plots, with greater abundance but lower species richness in deforested landscapes. Fruit bat captures in controls and tree island plots declined with increasing landscape tree cover, but captures in plantations were relatively constant. Individual species responded differentially to tree cover measured at different spatial scales. We attribute restoration effects primarily to habitat structure rather than food resources because no planted trees produced fruits regularly eaten by bats. The magnitude of tree planting effects on fruit bats was less than previous studies have found for frugivorous birds, suggesting that bats may play a particularly important role in dispersing seeds in heavily deforested and naturally regenerating areas. Nonetheless, our results show that larger tree plantations in more intact landscapes are more likely to attract diverse fruit bats, potentially enhancing seed dispersal.

ID VERTEBRATES; ALLIGATORS
AB A male-biased sex ratio of 3:1 has been reported for a population of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) in the Tempisque River Basin, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. If confirmed, this would constitute one of the largest male-biased sex ratios reported for any population of a member of the genus Crocodylus. Here, we examine the aforementioned population of C. acutus and report on sex ratios of hatchling, juvenile, and adult age classes within a sample of 474 crocodiles captured in the Tempisque Basin between May 2012 and June 2014. Hatch ling sex ratio is exceptionally male biased (3.5:1), an imbalance that is maintained in juveniles but is reduced in adults (1.5:1). Mark-recapture data document that juvenile males disperse from the study site, potentially to avoid competition, a process that reduces male bias in the adult age class. An increased role of males in human-crocodile conflict may be a result of juvenile males dispersing to human-inhabited areas.

AB Understanding the influence of microclimates is an increasing focus of investigations of global change risks to insects. Here we review recent advances in this area in the context of macrophysiological forecasts of the impacts of warming. Some studies have suggested that risk estimates may be inaccurate owing to microclimate variation or behavioural responses. Using modelled microclimatic data we illustrate this problem, demonstrating that soil microclimates on the Australian continent will warm in concert with global climate change such that the upper thermal tolerance limits of many insects will be exceeded across much of the continent. Deeper microclimates will be cooler and more hospitable, emphasising the importance of behavioural adaptation and movement amongst microclimates as a response to environmental warming.

AB Encroachment by alien species is the second greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide. As South Africa's Cape Floristic Region has a botanical endemism of nearly 70%, conservation efforts are a high priority. Estimates suggest that alien species cost the country over R6.5 billion per year. Despite significant research on alien species dispersal, the role of tourists as seed dispersers requires further exploration. To investigate the potential role tourists play in introducing alien seeds into protected areas, long-bristle brushes were used to scrape seeds off the shoes of hikers, dog walkers and cyclists, as well as the wheels of mountain bikes and dogs themselves, upon entering the Silvermine Nature Reserve section of the Table Mountain National Park in the Western Cape province, South Africa. In addition, a vegetation survey was conducted. This comprised 18 transects at various distances from the recreational paths in the park, and used a prioritisation ranking system that identified the alien species of greatest concern. It was concluded that the greatest number of alien plant species could be found along dog paths, in comparison to the hiking trails and cycling trails. This corresponded to the findings that dog walkers had the highest incidence of seeds on their shoes, suggesting that tourists were possibly dispersing seeds from their gardens. Alien species significantly covered more of the vegetation transects closer to the trails than they did in transects further into the matrix. Because more alien species were present in areas susceptible to human disturbance, the data suggest that tourists can act as vectors for alien seed dispersal. These findings emphasise the need for active tourism management in line with the South African National Parks Biodiversity Monitoring Programme in order to prevent the introduction and spread of alien species into South Africa's protected areas.
   Conservation implications: Tourism is the main source of revenue for South African National Parks, and one of the organisation's principal goals is to create a tourism management policy conducive to conservation. This research explores the potential role that tourists may play in the introduction of non-native species into a protected area, thereby providing novel information that could assist managers in the sustainable management of protected areas.

AB Balanites maughamii appears to be an obligate elephant-dispersed species. Its fruits are strongly scented and produce a large range of volatiles, particularly aliphatic acids such as hexanoic and isovaleric acid. The seed coat can resist a compression force of > 1.5 kN. Seeds removed from the seed coat, and those from compressed seeds or from elephant dung, have better germination than seeds enclosed by undamaged seed-coats, which largely failed to germinate over a 2-moperiod. Mastication by elephants may be necessary to split the seed coat to allow germination and the germinant to emerge from the seed coat. We identify four traits of elephant-dispersed fruits; they are dull-coloured, presented on the ground, strongly scented and have exceptionally strong seed coats.

   LANDSCAPE CHANGES; SPECIES RICHNESS; NATURAL-HISTORY; BIRD ABUNDANCE
AB Habitat loss and fragmentation of forests are among the biggest threats to biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. We use the vicinity of the Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica as a regional case study to document seven decades of land-use change in one of the most intensively studied sites in the Neotropics. Though the premontane wet forest was largely intact in 1947, a wave of immigration in 1952 initiated rapid changes over a short period. Overall forest cover was reduced during each time interval analyzed (1947-1960, 1960-1980, 1980-1997, 1997-2014), although the vast majority of forest loss (> 90%) occurred during the first two time intervals (1947-1960, 1960-1980) with an annual deforestation rate of 2.14% and 3.86%, respectively. The rate dropped to < 2% thereafter and has been offset by forest recovery in fallow areas more recently, but overall forest cover has continued to decline. Approximately 27.9% of the study area is forested currently. Concomitantly, the region shifted from a single contiguous forest to a series of progressively smaller forest fragments with each successive survey. A strong reduction in the amount of core habitat was paralleled by an increased proportion of edge habitat, due to the irregular shape of many forest fragments. Structural connectivity, however, remains high, with an expansive network of > 100 km of linear strips of vegetation within a 3 km radius of the station, which may facilitate landscape-level movement for some species. Despite the extent of forest loss, a substantial number of regional landscape-level studies over the past two decades have demonstrated the persistence of many groups of organisms such as birds and mammals. Nonetheless, the continued decline in the quantity and quality of remaining habitat (similar to 30% of remaining forest is secondary), as well as the threat of an extinction debt (or time lag in species loss), may result in the extirpation of additional species if more proactive conservation measures are not taken to reverse current trends-a pattern that reflects many other tropical regions the world over.

AB Oxpeckers reduce tick loads on ungulate hosts, but they are also known to feed on and exacerbate wounds. An understanding of the feeding behaviours and host preferences of these birds is important since they serve as agents of tick control on both domestic and wild ungulates. We conducted an observational study at two sites within the Kruger National Park in South Africa, exploring the feeding preferences of both Red-billed and Yellow-billed Oxpeckers. Oxpeckers' host preferences, body-location preferences on different hosts, prevalence of feeding and non-feeding behaviours, and frequency of tolerance versus rejection in different hosts were determined. It was found that Yellow-billed Oxpeckers had a smaller range of hosts-typically larger-sized ungulates-and that Red-billed Oxpeckers diversify to smallersized ungulate hosts when in competition with Yellow-billed Oxpeckers. Body-location preferences were generally consistent across sites and across host species. Tick feeding and other host-feeding behaviours (around the eyes, nose, mouth and ears, and anogenital areas) were fairly common. Only six incidents of wound feeding, from a total of 855 observations, were recorded. Tolerance by an ungulate host species was not related to Oxpeckers' host preferences, suggesting that other factors such as ungulate body size, tick species and tick stages on the host animal may play a significant role in the feeding preferences of Oxpeckers.
   Conservation implications: It is important to study Oxpeckers' behavioural feeding preferencesysoyasyto better understand their ecology and present distribution, and to determine where they can be reintroduced in future. Reintroduction not only helps with the proliferation of Oxpeckers, but also benefits ungulate hosts through ectoparasite removal and the subsequent control of tick-borne diseases.

AB We conducted extensive mist netting and radio tracking of common frugivorous, seed-dispersing, and tropical forest-dwelling blue-crowned manakins (Lepidothrix coronata; BCMA) and white-ruffed manakins (Corapipo altera; WRMA) to study their habitat use, movements, breeding success, and seed dispersal potential in the fragmented landscape of southern Costa Rica. We obtained 1354 GPS locations from 20 BCMAs and 4040 GPS locations from 54 WRMAs we tracked. These birds were dependent on forest remnants and rarely moved through open habitats. This was more likely for WRMAs, which were slightly more tolerant of forest fragmentation. BCMAs preferred the local Las Cruces Forest Reserve and riparian corridors to smaller (<10 ha) and more isolated forest fragments. Radio tracking showed that both species used small forest fragments less than expected based on the birds' sites of capture. In general, age ratios were immature-biased and sex ratios were female-biased, especially in riparian corridors, which enabled movements across the highly deforested landscape. Average daily nest survival rate was 92.2 % for BCMA nests and 97.1 % for WRMA nests. Both species used riparian corridors 3-5 times more than expected based on land cover, utilizing these corridors for food, water, breeding, and for moving across a highly deforested landscape. Although most movements of both species were 100 m or less, some birds moved more than 600 m between observations, sometimes in only 15 min. These manakins are abundant in the forest understory and are capable of dispersing seeds more than 600 m, helping the regeneration of native vegetation. Tropical countryside riparian corridors provide critical habitat and connectivity for these common seed-dispersing forest understory birds in a fragmented landscape.

AB Extinction rates in the Anthropocene are three orders of magnitude higher than background and disproportionately occur in the tropics, home of half the world's species. Despite global efforts to combat tropical species extinctions, lack of high-quality, objective information on tropical biodiversity has hampered quantitative evaluation of conservation strategies. In particular, the scarcity of population-level monitoring in tropical forests has stymied assessment of biodiversity outcomes, such as the status and trends of animal populations in protected areas. Here, we evaluate occupancy trends for 511 populations of terrestrial mammals and birds, representing 244 species from 15 tropical forest protected areas on three continents. For the first time to our knowledge, we use annual surveys from tropical forests worldwide that employ a standardized camera trapping protocol, and we compute data analytics that correct for imperfect detection. We found that occupancy declined in 22%, increased in 17%, and exhibited no change in 22% of populations during the last 3-8 years, while 39% of populations were detected too infrequently to assess occupancy changes. Despite extensive variability in occupancy trends, these 15 tropical protected areas have not exhibited systematic declines in biodiversity (i.e., occupancy, richness, or evenness) at the community level. Our results differ from reports of widespread biodiversity declines based on aggregated secondary data and expert opinion and suggest less extreme deterioration in tropical forest protected areas. We simultaneously fill an important conservation data gap and demonstrate the value of large-scale monitoring infrastructure and powerful analytics, which can be scaled to incorporate additional sites, ecosystems, and monitoring methods. In an era of catastrophic biodiversity loss, robust indicators produced from standardized monitoring infrastructure are critical to accurately assess population outcomes and identify conservation strategies that can avert biodiversity collapse.

ID KRUGER-NATIONAL-PARK; LOXODONTA-AFRICANA
AB Human settlement expansion into elephant ranges, as well as increasing elephant populations within confined areas has led to heightened levels of human- elephant conflict in southern African communities living near protected areas. Several methods to mitigate this conflict have been suggested including the use of bees as an elephant deterrent. We investigated whether bee auditory and olfactory cues (as surrogates for live bees) could be used to effectively deter elephants. We evaluated the responses of elephants in the southern section of the Kruger National Park to five different treatments: (1) control noise, (2) buzzing bee noise, (3) control noise with honey scent, (4) honey scent, and (5) bee noise with honey scent. Elephants did not respond or displayed less heightened responses to the first four treatments. All elephants exposed to the bee noise with honey scent responded with defensive behaviours and 15 out of 21 individuals also fled. We concluded that buzzing bees or honey scent as isolated treatments (as may be the case with dormant beehives) were not effective elephant deterrents, but rather an active beehive emitting a combination of auditory and olfactory cues was a viable deterrent. However, mismatches in the timing of elephant raids and activity of bees may limit the use of bees in mitigating the prevailing human- elephant conflict.

AB Rhini (Grahamstown) in 2015 experienced xenophobic attacks at the very moment as the #RUShutdown student protests at the university currently known as Rhodes University (UCKAR). The students and supporters often referred to the popular Audre Lorde saying that "There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle". In so doing, the students affirmed intersectionality as well as the full participation of marginalised bodies in the process of decolonising institutional acts and practices of oppression in higher learning. In addition, the students in their efforts to decolonise institutions of higher learning (by, for instance, taking down symbols of exploitation and privilege) sought to connect what was happening at university campuses to larger social challenges, particularly around gender-based violence, inequality and xenophobia.
   In this briefing, albeit cognizant of the interconnectedness of student movements across the country, I focus primarily on the efforts of the Black Students Movement (BSM) at UCKAR. I narrate two key moments at UCKAR in 2015, these being: the #RhodesSoWhite moment exposing institutionalised racism at Rhodes, as well as #RUShutdown challenging fee increments and initial fee payments that exclude poor and low-income students. I narrate these moments through the microblogging site, Twitter. I tie these moments at UCKAR to the larger context eRhini which at this very same time was grappling with xenophobic attacks that displaced over 500 people. I look at what it means to have xenophobic incidences in a place where students are calling for the embracing of differences across class, geographical location, and social status through decolonisation. I argue that the student movements, as well as the xenophobic attacks, bring into question issues about otherness, disadvantage and inequality pervasive in socio-historical relations. Moreover, through the lens of gender (specifically #RapeAtAzania and more recently the #RUReferenceList), I contend that some of the intramovement challenges the students have grappled with (including homophobia and sexual assault) show despite the gains of the students - the limitations of the work of decolonisation occurring primarily in the higher education sector, and not reflected in wider South African societies.

AB The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica. We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region. This GEE application illustrates new opportunities for biosystems engineers and other scientists to integrate historical vegetation and land cover data into comprehensive datasets to understand human impacts on ecosystems, and provides the guidance to do so.

DT Review
DE skin-lightening; biological; psychological; social; biopsychosocial;

ID COMPLICATIONS; RISKS
AB Skin-lightening is an aesthetic practice of global concern. By adopting a biopsycho-social approach, we consider the interplay between the biological, psychological and social factors that underpin the circulation and consumption of skin lighteners in South Africa. This paper reflects on biological aspects of skin lightening, interpersonal relationships, individual beliefs and expectations about the maintenance of health and well being that informs cosmetic practices. The paper seeks to examine claims made by historians (Thomas) and political philosophers and activists (Biko) that colonialism and apartheid in South Africa historically reinforced the use of skin lightening products in the country. The paper also investigates the role of media in staking out the boundaries of beauty. We argue that men and women practice skin lightening not only as a complex result of the internalization of global standards of beauty,, but meshed with a national politics of race and colorism. Banning skin lightening products without understanding the biological effects but also the social forces that underlie their increased popularity will prove futile. Moreover, we must consider the immeasurable pleasures associated with lightening, and the feelings with achieving visibility in South Africa, a country that continues to wrestle with blackness.

AB In contemporary society, protected areas are increasingly expected to justify their existence through the services that they provide to society. Protected areas offer many important cultural services, but appraisal of these nonmaterial benefits has generally proven difficult and most studies have focused on single case studies. Data on tourist numbers across multiple camps and protected areas provide a tractable and previously unexploited case study for better understanding the economic sustainability of cultural service provision and the relevance of potentially confounding variables (e.g., location and infrastructure) for park sustainability. We used redundancy analysis and linear models to relate a 5-yr monthly data set (2007-2012) of tourist numbers and tourism-derived income in all camps in South African national parks to a set of largely GIS-derived, determinant attributes that captured key elements of location, biodiversity, infrastructure, and accommodation cost at a camp level. Our analysis suggests that the degree to which cultural services can be converted into revenue for conservation is strongly contingent on infrastructure, location, and the business model that the park adopts. When considered alone, ecological attributes explained 14.2% and 3% of day and overnight visitation rates, respectively. In contrast, models that considered ecosystems in combination with other elements could explain 53% and 67% of variation. Linear models confirmed the existence of complex interactions between groups of variables and highlighted individual covariates that affected visitation rates. Significant variables included ecological features that provided aesthetic services, number of water bodies, elevation, available units, unit costs, and distance to the coast, airports, and other national parks. Taken in context our results suggest that it may be simpler than expected to make predictions about the potential future economic viability of protected areas under alternative models of management, illustrate how ecological variables may represent the "supply" side in cultural services, and highlight the complex interplay between ecological and built infrastructure. Encouragingly, this in turn suggests that relatively small, targeted investments in infrastructure could lead to disproportionate increases in tourist visitation rates and hence in increased revenue for conservation.

AB Defaunation is causing declines of large-seeded animal-dispersed trees in tropical forests worldwide, but whether and how these declines will affect carbon storage across this biome is unclear. Here we show, using a pan-tropical data set, that simulated declines of large-seeded animal-dispersed trees have contrasting effects on aboveground carbon stocks across Earth's tropical forests. In our simulations, African, American and South Asian forests, which have high proportions of animal-dispersed species, consistently show carbon losses (2-12%), but Southeast Asian and Australian forests, where there are more abiotically dispersed species, show little to no carbon losses or marginal gains (+/- 1%). These patterns result primarily from changes in wood volume, and are underlain by consistent relationships in our empirical data (similar to 2,100 species), wherein, large-seeded animal-dispersed species are larger as adults than small-seeded animal-dispersed species, but are smaller than abiotically dispersed species. Thus, floristic differences and distinct dispersal mode-seed size-adult size combinations can drive contrasting regional responses to defaunation.

AB Complex animal-plant interactions are present in the Neotropical bat family Phyllostomidae. Many of these interactions are still unknown, mainly due to the paucity of information available on the diet and habits of these species. The wrinkle-faced bat, Centurio senex, has been always considered as an enigmatic species. However, emerging evidence has partially elucidated the feeding ecology of this bat, confirming adaptations to consume hard food items. In addition to this information, here we show evidence of the predation of the seeds of Sideroxylon capiri (Sapotaceae) by C. senex. Bats employed principally deep unilateral bites to process the seeds. Our observations show that endocarp hardness has important implications on the ecological interaction between C. senex and S. capiri, due to the bats inability to puncture seeds with harder endocarps, causing an alternation between predation and dispersal of seeds. Nutritional rewards could be related to the predatory behavior documented. However, additional information is needed to clarify seed predation and seed dispersal patterns that exist between the 2 species.

AB Questions: Vascular epiphytes constitute a large proportion of tropical forest plant biodiversity, but are among the slowest plants to recolonize secondary forests. We asked whether tree planting for ecological restoration accelerates epiphyte community recovery. Does the spatial configuration of tree planting matter? What landscape contexts are most suitable for epiphyte restoration?
   Location: Restored pastures in premontane Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica.
   Methods: We surveyed vascular epiphyte species growing on the lower trunks of 1083 trees in 13 experimental restoration sites. Each site contained three 0.25-ha treatment plots: natural regeneration, trees planted in patches or 'islands' and tree plantations. Sites spanned elevational (1100-1430 m) and deforestation (4-94% forest cover within a 100-m radius around each site) gradients.
   Results: Vascular epiphytes were twice as diverse in planted restoration plots (islands and plantations) as in natural regeneration; we observed this at the scale of individual host trees and within 0.25-ha treatment plots. Contributing factors included that trees in planted restoration plots were larger, older, more abundant and composed of different species than trees in naturally regenerating plots. Epiphyte species richness increased with surrounding forest cover within 100150 m of restoration plots. Epiphyte communities were also twice as diverse at higher (1330-1430 m) vs lower (1100-1290 m) elevation sites. Epiphyte groups responded differently to restoration treatments and landscape factors; ferns were responsible for higher species richness in planted restoration plots, whereas angiosperms drove elevation and forest cover effects.
   Conclusions: Tree planting for ecological restoration enriched epiphyte communities compared to natural regeneration, likely because planted forests contained more, bigger and older trees. Tree island plantings were equally effective compared to larger and more expensive plantations. Restoration sites nearer to existing forests had richer epiphyte recolonization, likely because nearby forests provisioned restoration sites with angiosperm seeds. Collectively, results suggest that restoration practitioners can enrich epiphyte community development by planting trees in areas with higher surrounding forest cover, particularly at higher elevations.

AB Middle America is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, harboring an exceptional number of rare and endemic species. This is especially true of Middle American cloud forests, where montane specialists occupy restricted, high-elevation ranges making them attractive candidates for investigating historical biogeography and speciation. One such highland-restricted species, the black speckled palm-pitviper (Bothriechis nigroviridis), occupies the Central, Tilaran, and Talamanca Cordilleras in Costa Rica and Panama. In this study, we investigate the genetic and morphological variation among populations of B. nigroviridis by inferring a multilocus phylogeny (21 individuals) and analyzing meristic scale characters with a principal component analysis (64 individuals). We find B. nigroviridis sensu stricto to be composed of two deeply divergent lineages, one with a restricted range in the northern and central Cordillera Talamanca and the other ranging throughout the Central, Tilaran, and Talamanca Cordilleras. Furthermore, these two lineages are morphologically distinct, with previously unrecognized differences in several characters allowing us to name and diagnose a new species B. nubestris sp. nov. We also examine the genetic and morphological variation within B. nigroviridis and discuss biogeographic hypotheses that may have led to the diversification of Bothriechis lineages.

AB Soil and litter arthropods represent a large proportion of tropical biodiversity and perform important ecosystem functions, but little is known about the efficacy of different tropical forest restoration strategies in facilitating their recovery in degraded habitats. We sampled arthropods in four 7- to 8-year-old restoration treatments and in nearby reference forests. Sampling was conducted during the wet and dry seasons using extractions from litter and pitfall samples. Restoration treatments were replicated in 50 x 50-m plots in four former pasture sites in southern Costa Rica: plantation - trees planted throughout the plot; applied nucleation/islands - trees planted in patches of different sizes; and natural regeneration - no tree planting. Arthropod abundance, measures of richness and diversity, and a number of functional groups were greater in the island treatment than in natural regeneration or plantation treatments and, in many cases, were similar to reference forest. Litter and pitfall morphospecies and functional group composition in all three restoration treatments were significantly different than reference sites, but island and plantation treatments showed more recovery than natural regeneration. Abundance and functional group diversity showed a much greater degree of recovery than community composition. Synthesis and applications: The less resource-intensive restoration strategy of planting tree islands was more effective than tree plantations in restoring arthropod abundance, richness, and functional diversity. None of the restoration strategies, however, resulted in similar community composition as reference forest after 8 years of recovery, highlighting the slow rate of recovery of arthropod communities after disturbance, and underscoring the importance of conservation of remnant forests in fragmented landscapes.

AB Spatial variation in global climate change makes population-specific responses to this enigmatic threat pertinent on a regional scale. Organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) potentially possess a unique physiological susceptibility that threatens population viability if rapid environmental effects on sex ratios render populations non-viable. A heavily male-biased sex ratio for hatchling American crocodiles of the Tempisque Basin, Costa Rica requires assessment of how nest temperature affects sex determination at this site, how females might compensate for these effects when creating nests, and how current patterns of climate change might alter future sex ratios and survival in hatchling cohorts. We demonstrate high within-nest variation in temperature but predict a female bias at hatching based on nest temperatures quantified here. Further, our data suggest that egg size and metabolic heating associated with this factor outweighs microhabitat parameters and depth in influencing nest thermal regimes. Finally, we document regional warming in the Tempisque Basin over the last 15 years and project that further heating over the next 15 years will not yield hatchling sex ratios as male biased as those currently found at this site. Thus, we find no support for nest temperature or climate change as likely explanations for male-biased American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) sex ratios in the Tempisque Basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Establishing diverse mycorrhizal fungal communities is considered important for forest recovery, yet mycorrhizae may have complex effects on tree growth depending on the composition of fungal species present. In an effort to understand the role of mycorrhizal fungi community in forest restoration in southern Costa Rica, we sampled the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community across eight sites that were planted with the same species (Inga edulis, Erythrina poeppigiana, Terminalia amazonia, and Vochysia guatemalensis) but varied twofold to fourfold in overall tree growth rates. The AMF community was measured in multiple ways: as percent colonization of host tree roots, by DNA isolation of the fungal species associated with the roots, and through spore density, volume, and identity in both the wet and dry seasons. Consistent with prior tropical restoration research, the majority of fungal species belonged to the genus Glomus and genus Acaulospora, accounting for more than half of the species and relative abundance found on trees roots and over 95% of spore density across all sites. Greater AMF diversity correlated with lower soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations and longer durations of prior pasture use across sites. Contrary to previous literature findings, AMF species diversity and spore densities were inversely related to tree growth, which may have arisen from trees facultatively increasing their associations with AMF in lower soil fertility sites. Changes to AMF community composition also may have led to variation in disturbance susceptibility, host tree nutrient acquisition, and tree growth. These results highlight the potential importance of fungal-tree-soil interactions in forest recovery and suggest that fungal community -dynamics could have important implications for tree growth in disturbed soils.

AB We congratulate the authors on an important contribution to temperature reconstruction methodology applicable to pollen data. Pollen data is more challenging to model than other climate proxies, such as measurements on tree rings, because of the categorical nature of pollen assemblage data and the dating uncertainty inherent to any sedimentary proxy. The authors are commended on developing a reconstruction methodology that incorporates Bchron and Bummer.

AB Land-use change may alter both species diversity and species functional diversity patterns. To test the idea that species diversity and functional diversity changes respond in differing ways to land-use changes, we characterize the form of the change in bird assemblages and species functional traits along an intensifying gradient of land use in the savanna biome in a historically homogeneous vegetation type in Phalaborwa, South Africa. A section of this vegetation type has been untransformed, and the remainder is now mainly characterized by urban and subsistence agricultural areas. Using morphometric, foraging and breeding functional traits of birds, we estimate functional diversity changes. Bird species richness and abundance are generally higher in urban and subsistence agricultural land uses, as well as in the habitat matrix connecting these regions, than in the untransformed area, a pattern mainly driven through species replacement. Functionally unique species, particularly ground nesters of large body size, were, however, less abundant in more utilized land uses. For a previously homogenous vegetation type, declines in the seasonality of energy availability under land-use change have led to an increase in local avian diversity, promoting the turnover of species, but reduced the abundance of functionally unique species. Although there is no simple relationship between land-use and diversity change, land-use change may suit some species, but such change may also involve functional homogenization.

AB The novel ecosystem (NE) concept has been presented as a new paradigm or framework for ecological restoration. However, NEs are imprecisely defined for any practical applications and are based on theory not evidence. Furthermore, the NE concept remains descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and offers no testable predictions for researchers or concrete management guidelines. Current restoration concepts and practice already admit various possibilities for dealing with ecosystems for which recovery to an historical trajectory or environmental variation range is not the best option. Nonanalog ecosystems are real, but we caution against overvaluation and the undesirable outcomes of a contagion phenomenon.

AB Termite mounds have recently been shown to protect against drought by providing refuges for plants and foci for revegetation, but whether mounds modulate temperature remains untested. Organisms tend to experience climate at finer scales than those captured by models predicting how distributions alter with global change, so microclimates represent important "climate refuges." Using data we collected from African savanna sites, generalized linear mixed-effects models and linear quantile regression analysis confirm for the first time that the woody species associated with large termite mounds establish microclimates that are significantly cooler than surrounding savannas, a cooling effect that is even greater at warmer extremes. As air temperatures approached 40 degrees C, a cooling effect of up to 4 degrees C occurred, representing a doubling from that observed at 34 degrees C. African savannas encompass 10 million km(2), and much of this harbors evenly dispersed termitaria. The temperature-modulating effect of mounds facilitates agricultural and conservation decision-making as global change begins to impact the integrity of both human well-being and ecological processes.

AB While protected areas are a key component of the global conservation strategy, quantitative demonstrations of their positive ecological performance, meaning the extent to which they conserve the biodiversity features they were designated for, is broadly lacking. This commentary presents the emerging field of impact of evaluation of protected areas, with a focus on establishing their ecological performance. It highlights recent advances in protected area evaluations and explores the challenges remaining in developing a more credible evidence base to demonstrate the biodiversity conservation benefits of protected areas.

AB Whether or not sexually selected traits consistently exhibit positive allometry (i.e. are disproportionately large in larger individuals) is an ongoing debate. Multiple models and exceptions to this rule suggest that the underlying drivers of sexual trait allometry are nuanced. Here, we compare allometries of sexual and non-sexual traits of a species (Anolis aquaticus) within a well-studied lizard genus to test the competing hypotheses that sexual traits are, or are not, defined by positive allometry. We further consider the relationships of trait functions, which are relatively well understood in the genus Anolis, and allometry to identify potential drivers of allometric patterns. In particular, we explore how trait allometries interact to influence total organism function and generate sexual dimorphism. We quantified size (of targeted traits) and color of a sexual signal (the dewlap) in Anolis aquaticus in the field. The dewlap conveyed information relevant to intra-sexual combat and exhibited positive allometry. Overall, our results suggest that using single-trait allometries as indicators of past selection provides only an incomplete understanding of trait evolution. Although the function of positive allometry in some individual sexual signals (e.g. those conveying super-honest information) may be straightforward, we illustrate how scaling relationships interact synergistically to influence the function of phenotypes and propose avenues for future research.

AB Many species use color change to optimize body coloration to changing environmental conditions, and drivers of rapid color change in natural populations are numerous and poorly understood. We examined factors influencing body coloration in the Water Anole (Anolis aquaticus Taylor, 1956), a lizard possessing color-changing stripes along the length of its body. We quantified the color of three body regions (the eye stripe, lateral stripe, and dorsum) before and after exposure to a mild stressor (handling and restraint). Based on current understanding of the genus Anolis Daudin, 1802, we hypothesized that exposure to a stressor would generate genus-typical skin darkening (i.e., increased melanism). Contrary to expectations, stress consistently brightened body coloration: eye and lateral stripes transitioned from brown to pale blue and green and the dorsum became lighter brown. Sex, size, and body temperature did not correlate with any aspect of body coloration, and a laboratory experiment confirmed that light exposure did not drive brightening. We propose that color change may serve to reduce conspicuousness through disruptive camouflage; lizards tended to display brighter stripes on mottled green-brown substrates. Together, these results improve our understanding of Anolis color change diversity and emphasize the need for a broader interpretation of the mechanism and functions of color change across taxa.

AB The Neotropics, Afrotropics and Madagascar have different histories which have influenced their respective patterns of diversity. Based on current knowledge of these histories, we developed the following predictions about the phylogenetic structure and composition of rainforest tree communities: (Hypothesis 1) isolation of Gondwanan biotas generated differences in phylogenetic composition among biogeographical regions; (H2) major Cenozoic extinction events led to lack of phylogenetic structure in Afrotropical and Malagasy communities; (H3) greater angiosperm diversification in the Neotropics led to greater phylogenetic clustering there than elsewhere; (H4) phylogenetic overdispersion is expected near the Andes due to the co-occurrence of magnoliids tracking conserved habitat preferences and recently diversified eudicot lineages. Using abundance data of tropical rainforest tree species from 94 communities in the Neotropics, Afrotropics and Madagascar, we computed net relatedness index (NRI) to assess local phylogenetic structure, i.e. phylogenetic clustering vs. overdispersion relative to regional species pools, and principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS) to assess variation in phylogenetic composition across communities. We observed significant differences in phylogenetic composition among biogeographical regions (agreement with H1). Overall phylogenetic structure did not differ among biogeographical regions, but results indicated variation from Andes to Amazon. We found widespread phylogenetic randomness in most Afrotropical and all Malagasy communities (agreement with H2). Most of central Amazonian communities were phylogenetically random, although some communities presented phylogenetic clustering (partial agreement with H3). We observed phylogenetic overdispersion near the Andes (agreement with H4). We were able to identify how differences in lineage composition are related to local phylogenetic co-occurrences across biogeographical regions that have been undergoing different climatic and orographic histories during the past 100 Myr. We observed imprints of the history following Gondwana breakup on phylobetadiversity and local phylogenetic structure of rainforest tree communities in the Neotropics, Afrotropics and Madagascar.

AB Endocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDC's) are well known to alter sexual differentiation among vertebrates via estrogenic effects during development, particularly in organisms characterized by temperature-dependent sex determination. However, substances producing androgenic effects typically lack potency when tested in laboratory settings and are virtually unstudied in field settings. Here, we assay levels of a synthetic androgen, 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT), in a heavily male-biased population of American crocodiles in the Tempisque River Basin of Costa Rica based on the recent hypothesis that this chemical is an EDC in developing crocodilian embryos. The presence of MT was documented in all field collected samples of egg yolk and in plasma of all age classes in among population of crocodiles. Hatchlings exhibited higher plasma MT concentrations (102.1 +/- 82.8 ng/mL) than juveniles (33.8 +/- 51.5) and adults (25.9 +/- 20.8 ng/mL). Among populations, crocodiles captured in the Tempisque River (62.9 +/- 73.7 ng/mL) were higher in MT concentration than those from Tarcoles (13.3 +/- 11.4 ng/mL) and negative controls (0.001 +/- 0.0002 ng/mL). A mechanism for the bio-transport of MT and its subsequent effects is proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
