AB Introduction
   Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a rapidly increasing cause of mortality whose dismal prognosis is mainly due to overwhelming chemoresistance. New therapeutic approaches include physical agents such as ultrasonic cavitation, but clinical applications require further insights in the mechanisms of cytotoxicity. 3-D in vitro culture models such as spheroids exploit realistic spatial, biochemical and cellular heterogeneity that may bridge some of the experimental gap between conventional in vitro and in vivo experiments.
   Purpose
   To assess the feasibility and efficiency of inertial cavitation associated or not with chemotherapy, in a spheroid model of PDAC.
   Methods
   We used DT66066 cells, derived from a genetically-engineered murine PDAC, isolated from KPC-transgenic mice (LSL-Kras(G12D/+;) LSL-Trp53(R172H/+;) Pdx-1-Cre). Spheroids were obtained by either a standard centrifugation-based method, or by using a magnetic nano-shuttle method allowing the formation of spheroids within 24 hours and facilitating their handling. The spheroids were exposed to ultrasonic inertial cavitation in a specially designed setup. Eight or nine spheroids were analyzed for each of 4 conditions: control, gemcitabine alone, US cavitation alone, US cavitation + gemcitabine. Five US inertial cavitation indexes, corresponding to increased US intensities, were evaluated. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed after 24 hours with the following criteria: spheroid size (growth), ratio of phase S-entered cells (proliferation), proportion of cells in apoptosis or necrosis (mortality). These parameters were assessed by quantitative immunofluorescence techniques.
   Results
   The 3D culture model presented excellent reproducibility. Cavitation induced a significant decrease in the size of spheroids, an effect significantly correlated to an increasing cavitation index (p < 0.0001). The treatment induced cell death whose predominant mechanism was necrosis (p < 0.0001). There was a tendency to a synergistic effect of US cavitation and gemcitabine at 5 mu M concentration, however significant in only one of the cavitation indexes used (p = 0.013).
   Conclusion
   Ultrasonic inertial cavitation induced a significant reduction of tumor growth in a spheroid model of PDAC., with necrosis rather than apoptosis as a Cell dominant mechanism of cell death. More investigations are needed to understand the potential role of inertial cavitation in overcoming chemoresistance.

TI A genetically engineered microRNA-34a prodrug demonstrates anti-tumor

AB Osteosarcoma (OSA) represents the most common primary bone tumor in humans and pet dogs. Little progress has been made with regard to viable treatment options in the past three decades and patients presenting with metastatic disease continue to have a poor prognosis. Recent mouse studies have suggested that microRNA-34a (miR-34a) may have anti-tumor activities in human OSA models. Due to the conservation of microRNA across species, we hypothesized that a bioengineered miR-34a prodrug (tRNA/miR-34a) would have similar effects in canine OSA, providing a valuable preclinical model for development of this therapeutic modality. Using a panel of canine OSA cell lines, we found that tRNA/miR-34a reduced viability, clonogenic growth, and migration and invasion while increasing tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, canine OSA cells successfully process the tRNA/miR-34a into mature miR-34a which reduces expression of target proteins such as platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha), Notch1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Additionally, our subcutaneous OSA xenograft model demonstrated in vivo tumor growth delay, increased necrosis and apoptosis by tRNA/miR-34a, and decreased cellular proliferation ability. Taken together, these data support that this novel microRNA-based therapy may possess clinical utility in a spontaneously-occurring large animal model of OSA, which can then serve to inform the clinical development of this therapy for human OSA patients.

AB Developing smart crops which yield more biomass to meet the increasing demand for plant biomass has been an active area of research in last few decades. We investigated metabolic alterations in two Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with enhanced growth characteristics that were previously obtained from a collection of plant lines expressing artificial transcription factors. The metabolic profiles were obtained directly from intact Arabidopsis leaves using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR. Multivariate analysis showed significant alteration of metabolite levels between the mutants and the wild-type Col-0. Interestingly, most of the metabolites that were reduced in the faster-growing mutants are generally involved in the defence against stress. These results suggest a growth-defence trade-off in the phenotypically engineered mutants. Our results further corroborate the idea that plant growth can be enhanced by suppressing defence pathways.

AB Thousand grain weight is one of the components determining wheat grain yield. It represents the average value of individual grain weights which depends on position within the ear and on positon within the spikelet. Our objective was to quantify the influences of individual floret anthesis date, of carpel weight at anthesis and of rate and duration of grain filling, on variation in individual final grain weight. Two bread wheat cultivars were grown in a greenhouse and their ears were sampled from anthesis through to harvest. Each ear was divided into three parts-basal, central and apical-where the two proximal grains were dissected from each of two spikelets. We analysed (i) the flowering time shift within the ear and within the spikelet; and (ii) the growth kinetics during grain filling in relation to position along the ear. For both cultivars, florets located in the central part of the ear were the first to reach anthesis followed by those in the apical part and then the basal part. Within a spikelet, the floret located nearest the rachis flowered first followed by the more distal ones. We found no significant systematic effect of flowering time-shift on final grain weight. Nevertheless, grains in the central part were heavier than the basal ones (9.75% smaller) and than the apical ones (18.25% smaller). These differences were explained mainly by differences in mean grain filling rates. Analysis of growth kinetics enabled an improved explanation of the variability of individual grain weight along the ear.

TI Lay provider HIV testing: A promising strategy to reach the undiagnosed
   key populations in Vietnam
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   In Vietnam, reaching the remaining one-third of undiagnosed people living with HIV and facilitating their antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrollment requires breakthrough approaches. We piloted lay provider HIV testing as an innovative approach to reach at-risk populations that never or infrequently HIV test at facility-based services.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey and analysis of routine program data in two urban provinces (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City) and two rural mountainous provinces (Nghe An and Dien Bien) from October 2015 through September 2017. Acceptability of lay provider testing was defined as the proportion of first-time HIV testers utilizing the service, and effectiveness was measured by HIV positivity and ART initiation rates. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine lay provider testing preference and factors associated with that preference.
   Results
   Among 1,230 individuals recruited for face-to-face interviews, 74% belonged to key populations: people who inject drugs accounted for 31.4%; men who have sex with men, 60.4%; and female sex workers, 8.2%. Most clients (67%) reported being first-time HIV testers, and the majority (85.8%) preferred lay provider testing to facility-based testing. Multivariate analysis found that clients in urban areas (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-4.90) and those who had a university or higher education (aOR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.05-3.20) were more likely to prefer lay provider testing. Lay provider testing yielded a higher HIV positivity rate (4.1%), particularly among first-time testers (6.8%), compared to facility-based testing (nationally estimated at 1.6% in 2016) and had a high ART initiation rate (91%).
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggest that lay provider HIV testing is an effective approach to reach previously unreached at-risk populations, and, therefore, a critical addition to accelerating Vietnam's attainment of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 goals.

TI Imported malaria in the UK, 2005 to 2016: Estimates from primary care
   electronic health records
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE; TRAVELERS; PERIODS
AB Objective
   To investigate trends in the incidence of imported malaria in the UK between 2005 and 2016.
   Design
   Analysis of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database.
   Setting
   UK primary care
   Participants
   In total, we examined 12,349,003 individuals aged 0 to 99 years.
   Outcome measure
   The rate of malaria recordings in THIN was calculated per year between 2005 and 2016. Rate ratios exploring differences by age, sex, location of general practice, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression.
   Results
   A total of 1,474 individuals with a first diagnosis of malaria were identified in THIN between 2005 and 2016. The incidence of recorded malaria followed a decreasing trend dropping from a rate of 3.33 in 2005 to 1.36 cases per 100,000 person years at risk in 2016. Multivariable Poisson regression showed that adults of working age (20 to 69 years), men, those registered with a general practice in London, higher social deprivation and non-white ethnicity were associated with higher rates of malaria recordings.
   Conclusion
   There has been a decrease in the number of malaria recordings in UK primary care over the past decade. This decrease exceeds the rate of decline reported in national surveillance data; however there are similar associations with age, sex and deprivation. Improved geographic information on the distribution of cases and the potential for automation of case identification suggests that EHRs could provide a complementary role for investigating malaria trends over time.

TI Trends in misoprostol use and abortion complications: A cross-sectional
   study from nine referral hospitals in Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNSAFE ABORTION; PREGNANCY; HEALTH
AB Objective
   The study aimed to assess the use of misoprostol and complications associated with abortions in referral hospitals in Nigeria, a country with restrictive abortion laws.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study at nine referral hospitals in South-west Nigeria. Nine years' data were retrieved from medical records, including 699 induced abortions. Independent variable was the method of abortion; dependent variables were complications, need for treatment and mortality. Statistical significance was tested with Chi-square, Fishers' exact and chi-square for trend tests (p<0.05).
   Results
   There were 699 induced abortions amongst 2,463 abortions found in records. Nearly 70% were surgical abortions, but misoprostol use significantly increased over the study period in a linear trend (chi(2) trend: 30.96, P < 0.001). Patients who used misoprostol were significantly less likely to have infectious morbidity, genital tract injuries or medical complications. There was no difference in incomplete abortion in the groups. Patients were more likely to have in-patient care with surgical abortions (p < 0.001), to need prolonged antibiotic regimens (p = 0.003), need further surgeries or additional specialist care (p = 0.009).
   Conclusion
   Misoprostol abortion has significantly increased over time, and was associated with less morbidity and need for further treatment, in this study. It appears to be the safer option.

AB Tropical forests in the Americas are undergoing rapid conversion to commercial agriculture, and many migratory bird species that use these forests have experienced corresponding populations declines. Conservation research for migratory birds in the tropics has focused overwhelmingly on shade coffee plantations and adjacent forest, but both cover types are now in decline, creating an urgent need to evaluate conservation opportunities in other agricultural systems. Here we compare how a community of 42 Neotropical migratory bird species and a subset of five conservation-priority species differ in usage and habitat associations among a secondary forest baseline and four expanding commercial plantation systems in Guatemala: African oil palm, teak, rubber, and mixed-native hardwoods. We found that mixed-native hardwood plantations supported the highest richness and diversity of all migrants and that the three hardwood plantation types generally outperformed oil palm in richness and diversity metrics. Despite this, oil palm supported high abundance of several common and widespread species also experiencing range-wide population declines and may therefore play an important role in conserving common species. Mature secondary forest hosted low abundance and diversity of the full migratory community, but high abundance and richness of conservation priority migrants along with native hardwood and teak plantations. Likewise, the percentage of forest cover on the landscape was positively associated with priority migrant abundance and richness but negatively associated with the abundance of migrants in general, highlighting how individual species within the broad group of Neotropical migratory landbirds respond differently to anthropogenic changes in land use. Across all cover types, the retention of tall overstory trees increased the abundance, richness, and diversity of all migrants, which indicates that vertical structural diversity and remnant trees are important habitat features for birds in agricultural landscapes. Our findings show that conservation opportunities exist in hardwood and oil palm plantations, though the species likely to benefit from conservation action will vary among plantation types. For the subset of conservation priority migrants, our results suggest that conservation efforts should combine strategies that retain and restore secondary forest, promote the adoption of native hardwood and teak plantations, and promote the retention of tall, remnant trees in agricultural landscapes.

TI Dynamic regulation of the Trypanosoma brucei transferrin receptor in
   response to iron starvation is mediated via the 3 ' UTR
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   COMPLEX; PROTEIN; LEVEL; SITE
AB The bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei obtains iron from its mammalian host by receptor-mediated endocytosis of host transferrin through its own unique transferrin receptor (TbTfR). Expression of TbTfR rapidly increases upon iron starvation by post-transcriptional regulation through a currently undefined mechanism that is distinct from the mammalian iron response system. We have created reporter cell lines by fusing the TbTfR 3'UTR or a control Aldolase 3'UTR to reporter genes encoding GFP or firefly Luciferase, and inserted the fusions into a bloodstream form cell line at a tagged ribosomal RNA locus. Fusion of the TbTfR 3'UTR is sufficient to significantly repress the expression of the reporter proteins under normal growth conditions. Under iron starvation conditions we observed upregulation of the mRNA and protein level of the TbTfR 3'UTR fusions only, with a magnitude and timing consistent with that reported for upregulation of the TbTfR. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of the T. brucei transferrin receptor in response to iron starvation is mediated via its 3'UTR, and that the effect is independent of genomic location.

AB Background
   Non-communicable diseases, including hypertension (HTN), are increasingly recognized as important causes of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in resource-limited settings. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of HTN among PLHIV in Senegal over time and to identify predictors of HTN among HIV-positive versus HIV-negative adults.
   Methods
   We conducted a retrospective study using data from individuals enrolled in previous studies in Senegal from 1994-2015. Blood pressure (BP) measurements taken during study visits were used for analysis. HTN was defined as systolic BP >= 140 or diastolic BP >= 90. We used logistic regression to identify predictors of HTN.
   Results
   We analyzed data from 2848 adults (1687 HIV-positive, 1161 HIV-negative). Among PLHIV, the prevalence of HTN increased from 11% during 1994-1999 to 22% during 2010-2015. Among HIV-negative individuals, the prevalence of HTN increased from 16% to 32%. Among both groups, the odds of HTN more than doubled from 1994-1999 to 2010-2015 (HIV-positive OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.0; HIV-negative OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.6). One quarter of all individuals with HTN had stage 2 HTN. The strongest risk factor for HTN was obesity (HIV-positive OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7-5.8; p<0.01; HIV-negative OR 7.8, 95% CI 4.5-13.6; p<0.01). Male sex and age >= 50 were also predictive of HTN among both groups. Among HIV-positive subjects, WHO stage 1 or 2 disease was predictive of HTN and among HIV-negative subjects, having no formal education was predictive.
   Conclusion
   Over the past 20 years, the prevalence of HTN has doubled among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults in Senegal. Our study indicates that there is an increasing need for the integration of chronic disease management into HIV programs in Senegal. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for enhanced prevention, recognition, and management of non-communicable diseases, including hypertension and obesity, among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in Senegal.

TI Mothers treatment seeking intention for neonatal danger signs in
   northwest Ethiopia: A structural equation modeling
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID 3 DELAYS MODEL; CARE-SEEKING; UNDERSTAND; BEHAVIOR
AB Background
   Neonatal mortality contributes to nearly half of under-five mortality in Ethiopia. Treatment seeking for newborn danger signs remains low despite correlations with neonatal mortality. This study tests a theoretical model of factors affecting mothers' treatment seeking intention for neonatal danger signs in northwest Ethiopia.
   Method
   A cross sectional study was conducted from March 3-18, 2016 in northwest Ethiopia. A total of 2,158 pregnant women and women who had delivered in the past 6 months were interviewed. Latent variables; knowledge of neonatal danger signs (KDS), household level women empowerment (HLWE) and positive perception toward the behavior of health care providers (PPBHCP) were measured using a Five Point Likert Scale. Socioeconomic status (SES), number of antenatal care attendance, perceived cost of treatment (PCT), average distance to health facilities (ADHF) and treatment seeking intention (TSI) were observed variables in the study. A structural equation modeling was applied to test and estimate the hypothesized model of relationships among latent and observed variables and their direct and indirect effects on TSI.
   Result
   KDS, PPBHCP, HLWE, and PCT showed direct, positive and significant association with TSI (beta = 0.41, p<0.001, beta = 0.08, p<0.002, beta = 0.18, p<0.001, and beta = 0.06, p<0.002, respectively). SES was not directly associated with TSI. However, it indirectly influenced TSI through three pathways; KDS, number of ANC attendance and HLWE (beta = 0.05, p<0.05, beta = 0.08, p<0.001 and beta = 0.13, p<0.001, respectively). Number of antenatal care was not directly associated with TSI. But indirectly, it affected TSI through its direct effect on KDS and PPBHCP (beta = 0.05, p<0.05, beta = 0.14, p<0.001, respectively). PPBHCP and HLWE also showed indirect association with TSI through their direct effect on KDS (beta = 0.37, p<0.001, beta = 0.36, p<0.001, respectively). All in all, the model fitted the sample data and explained 31% of the variance in TSI.
   Conclusion
   PPBHCP, HLWE, PCT and KDS were associated with mothers' TSI for newborn danger signs.

AB The availability of accurate techniques to discriminate between marked laboratory-reared flies and unmarked wild flies captured in monitoring traps is essential for programs that integrate the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to manage fruit flies. In this study, the feasibility of using a stable isotope marking technique for the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), was assessed. Wild flies were collected from apple orchards, which are a target of a SIT project in southern Brazil. To verify if adult flies could be labelled by the stable isotopes from larval diets, larvae were reared on two different C-4-based diets and fruits in laboratory. To evaluate the influence of the two most common attractants applied to capture A. fraterculus (grape juice and CeraTrap (TM)) and the most common preservation method in fruit fly collections (ethanol), laboratory-reared flies were immersed in McPhail traps containing the respective treatments for two periods of time. Samples were analyzed in an elemental analyzer coupled to a Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (CF-IRMS) at CENA/USP. The delta C-13 signatures of flies reared on artificial diets differed significantly from the delta C-13 of flies whose larvae were reared on fruits and from wild flies. In contrast, the delta N-15 values were less conclusive and the technique could not rely solely on them. In all cases considered, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures from males did not differ from females. Despite the alterations caused by the attractants tested and ethanol, laboratory-flies could be distinguished from the wild ones based on delta C-13 signatures. This is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish wild A. fraterculus from flies reared on larval diets containing C-4 sugar. The first experimentally derived trophic discrimination factors were also obtained for this species. Thus, intrinsic isotope labelling can serve as a backup to conventional dye marking.

AB Background
   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the commonest endocrine disorder affecting young women, appears to be a multigenic trait with contributing genes being unclear. Hence, analysis of polymorphisms in multiple candidate genes is required. Currently available genotyping methods are expensive, time-consuming with limited analytical sensitivity.
   Aim
   (i) Develop and validate high resolution melting (HRM) assay and allele-specific real-time quantitative PCR (AS-qPCR) for genotyping selected SNPs associated with PCOS.
   (ii) Identify selected SNPs and their association with a Sri Lankan cohort of well-characterized PCOS.
   Methods
   DNA was extracted from women with well-characterized PCOS from adolescence (n = 55) and ethnically matched controls (n = 110). FTO (Fat mass and obesity associated gene; rs9939609), FSHB (Follicle stimulating hormone beta subunit; rs6169), FSHR (Follicle stimulating hormone receptor; rs6165/rs6166), and INSR (Insulin receptor; rs1799817) genes were genotyped using HRM assay. GnRH1 (Gonadotropin releasing hormone; rs6185), LHB (Luteinizing hormone beta subunit; rs1800447/rs34349826) and LHCGR (Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor; rs2293275) genes were genotyped using AS-qPCR method. Genotyping results were validated using Sanger sequencing.
   Results
   A significant association was observed within FTO gene polymorphism (rs9939609) and PCOS. Genotype frequency of FTO gene (rs9939609)-cases versus controls were TT-36.4% vs.65.4% (p< 0.05), AT-23.6% vs. 20.9%, AA-40% vs. 13.6% (p< 0.05). Genotype frequencies of the SNPs GnRH1 (rs6185), FSHB (rs6169), FSHR (rs6165 & rs6166), LHB (rs1800447 & rs34349826), LHCGR (rs2293275) and INSR (rs1799817) were not significantly different between cases and controls (p> 0.05). Only the mutant alleles were observed for LHB rs1800447 and rs34349826 SNPs in both groups. The HRM and AS-qPCR assay results had 100% concordance with sequencing results.
   Conclusions
   FTO gene rs9939609 polymorphism is significantly more prevalent among Sri Lankan PCOS subjects while the other selected SNPs of HPG axis genes and INSR gene showed no association. HRM and AS-qPCR assays provide a reliable, fast and user-friendly genotyping method facilitating wider implication in clinical practice.

ID MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; TIME
AB Human Multipotent Stromal Cells (MSCs) are a valuable resource for regenerative medicine and are widely studied. They can be isolated from a variety of tissues and differentiate into multiple cell types (multi-potent). Many reports have been published using human MSCs and to be able to compare outcome, or be able to identify differences between MSCs, several cell surface markers have been proposed. Nevertheless, still many differences remain. Gene expression is known to be different between cell stage and origin. Furthermore, cells cultured on a culture dish (2D) show different gene expression profiles as compared to cells grown on scaffolds (3D). Even the RNA extraction method and the selection of genes used for normalisation have a role in gene expression profiling. To be able to compare gene expression data from samples cultured in different dimensions and RNA extracted using a variety of protocols we set out to define a set of reference genes suitable to normalise qPCR data from a very heterogeneous sample set. Hereto, Trizol was used to extract RNA from human MSCs cultured in 3D and 2D to validate newly designed and previously published primer sets. Subsequently, RNA from fresh human MSC samples and samples stored in RLT-buffer, Trizol or RNAlater was extracted using RNeasy and Trizol methods. All samples have been used to rank the candidate reference genes according to their stability after qPCR enabling identification of the most suitable reference gene(s) for normalisation of a heterogeneous sample set. The most stably expressed reference genes indicated superior normalisation of MSC marker gene expression over the least stable reference genes.

DT Article
ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; ETHICS; SERVICES; EXPERIENCE
AB Background
   Primary health care institutions are looking for opportunities to create value for patients and to increase the competitiveness of the health care institution. Determination of competitive priorities for creation of value for patients in the management of primary health care institutions allows improving competitiveness and achieving a competitive advantage in the market.
   The aim of the study
   To determine the priorities in the management of public and private primary health care institutions by using the focus group discussion method with managers.
   Methods
   The study was exploratory with intention to find a ground for a management theory and to be the root for the development of health care reform in Lithuania. Focus group discussions were held in 10 Lithuanian counties; 10 focus group sessions were carried out. A total of 48 primary health care executives were interviewed. The participants of this qualitative study were given 8 questions related to value creation of the primary health care institution to patients and rise in competitiveness. The main question of the focus group discussion was "What are the main priorities of management of primary health care institution?" The criteria of data collection based on the deep understanding of the phenomenon and the richness of data expressed by participants of the research.
   Results
   Qualitative research showed that the priorities of management of primary health care institutions were work management of an organization; human resources management; patient management; and health policy decision making. The participants of focus groups pointed out that effective work of primary health care institutions is ensured by the model of management, doctor-patient communication, quality and timely delivery of health care services, and financial resources. The major decisions involving the management of patients were as follows: meeting patients' expectations, quality and timely satisfaction of patients' needs, effective solution of patients' problems, patient-centered services, patient satisfaction, and communication with the patient. Accessibility to services, quality, geographical accessibility, disease prevention, strengthening of patients' health and adequate funding were mentioned as the priorities of health policy.

AB Schistosomiasis is a neglected parasitosis caused by Schistosoma spp. Praziquantel is used for the chemoprophylaxis and treatment of this disease. Although this monotherapy is effective, the risk of resistance and its low efficiency against immature worms compromises its effectiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new schistosomicide drugs. However, the development of new drugs is a long and expensive process. The repositioning of approved drugs has been proposed as a quick, cheap, and effective alternative to solve this problem. This study employs chemogenomic analysis with use of bioinformatics tools to search, identify, and analyze data on approved drugs with the potential to inhibit Schistosoma mansoni energy metabolism enzymes. The TDR Targets Database, Gene DB, Protein, DrugBank, Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD), Promiscuous, and PubMed databases were used. Fifty-nine target proteins were identified, of which 18 had one or more approved drugs. The results identified 20 potential drugs for schistosomiasis treatment; all approved for use in humans.

AB Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are common during prion infection, but the mechanisms that underlie these pathological features are not well understood. Several components of innate immunity, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and Complement C1q, have been shown to influence prion disease. To identify additional components of innate immunity that might impact prion disease within the central nervous system (CNS), we screened RNA from brains of pre-clinical and clinical 22L-infected mice for alterations in genes associated with innate immunity. Transcription of several genes encoding damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) proteins and receptors were increased in the brains of prion-infected mice. To investigate the role of some of these proteins in prion disease of the CNS, we infected mice deficient in DAMP receptor genes Tlr2, C3ar1, and C5ar1 with 22L scrapie. Elimination of TLR2 accelerated disease by a median of 10 days, while lack of C3aR1 or C5aR1 had no effect on disease tempo. Histopathologically, all knockout mouse strains tested were similar to infected control mice in gliosis, vacuolation, and PrPSc deposition. Analysis of proinflammatory markers in the brains of infected knockout mice indicated only a few alterations in gene expression suggesting that C5aR1 and TLR2 signaling did not act synergistically in the brains of prion-infected mice. These results indicate that signaling through TLR2 confers partial neuroprotection during prion infection.

DT Article
ID DNA METHYLATION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; POLLUTION; WORKERS; DISEASE; BRAIN;
   RISK
AB Objectives
   We investigated the association between occupational noise exposure and the risk of elevated blood pressure and hypertension by stage in young adults.
   Methods
   We utilized 124,286 young adults (18-40 years) from the Project ELEFANT study. We categorized occupational noise exposure as high (75 dBA noise exposure for more than 4 hours per day) or low, and measured blood pressure (mmHg) and categorized participants by hypertension stage (normal, elevated, Stage 1, Stage 2). We applied adjusted logistic regression models to identify associations with hypertension risk, and we further examined the noise-BMI, noise-gender, and noise-residence interactions on hypertension risk in separate models.
   Results
   High occupational noise exposure was associated with increases in blood pressure among participants with elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 0.23, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.46, p = 0.0009), in Stage 1 hypertension (Estimate = 0.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.25, p = 0.0008), and in Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 0.41 95% CI: 1.31, 1.73, p<0.0001). Likewise, noise exposure BMI interaction was consistently positively associated with increases in blood pressure in participants with elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 0.71, 95% CI: 1.55, 2.69, p<0.0001), in Stage 1 hypertension (Estimate = 0.78, 95% CI: 1.82, 2.61, p<0.0001), and in Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 2.06, 95% CI: 5.64, 10.81, p<0.0001). The noise exposure-male interaction showed higher risk for hypertension compared to the noise exposure-female interaction in participants with elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 1.24, 95% CI: 2.56, 4.71, p<0.0001), Stage 1 (Estimate = 1.67, 95% CI: 4.34, 6.42, p<0.0001) and Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 1.70, 95% CI: 3.86, 7.77, p<0.0001). Finally, we found that noise exposure-urban interaction was consistently associated with an increase in blood pressure in elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 0.32, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.62, p<0.0001) and in Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 0.44, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.80, p<0.0001).

AB Background
   Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public.
   Methods
   The present pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app 'Headspace' (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention.
   Results
   Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen's d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self-reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the control group.
   Conclusions
   This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that self-reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short-term engagement with a mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive studies.

AB The study had the goal to study the relationship between resilience, stress and injuries in the sport context. Eight female athletes, part of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Brazilian Team along the Olympic Cycle 2015-2016 participated in the study, with a mean age of 20.4 +/- 2.5 years. The following instruments were used: RESTQ-76 Sport, CD-RISC 10, documental analysis of physical therapy records, and structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation); Repeated Measured ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-hoc, Student's "t" test, Friedman test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Cohen's d, and inductive thematic analysis. We found relatively stable levels of stress and recovery across the season; total recovery levels were higher than stress at all four measured timepoints (p<0.05); All athletes had at least one injury, with a total of 14 injuries; No significant correlations were found between the quantitative scores of resilience, stress and recovery; Training and the sport's scoring system were the most relevant perceived stressors; athletes presented meta-cognition and a non-positive evaluation (neutral) of stressors; Social support was considered the main psychological factor for the resilience process; such process resulted in improved control and interpretation of emotions; Our hypothesized model proposes that, in the relationship between stress and injuries, resilience acts by optimizing the injury recovery process. It was concluded that resilience plays a role in the process of injury rehabilitation and stress control in elite rhythmic gymnastics' athletes.

AB Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a human pathogen responsible for diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). To promote a comprehensive insight into the molecular basis of EHEC O157:H7 physiology and pathogenesis, the combined proteome of EHEC O157:H7 strains, Clade 8 and Clade 6 isolated from cattle in Argentina, and the standard EDL933 (clade 3) strain has been analyzed. From shotgun proteomic analysis a total of 2,644 non-redundant proteins of EHEC O157:H7 were identified, which correspond approximately 47% of the predicted proteome of this pathogen. Normalized spectrum abundance factor analysis was performed to estimate the protein abundance. According this analysis, 50 proteins were detected as the most abundant of EHEC O157:H7 proteome. COG analysis showed that the majority of the most abundant proteins are associated with translation processes. A KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis was the most significant pathway. On the other hand, the less abundant detected proteins are those related to DNA processes, cell respiration and prophage. Among the proteins that composed the Type III Secretion System, the most abundant protein was EspA. Altogether, the results show a subset of important proteins that contribute to physiology and pathogenicity of EHEC O157:H7.

AB According to the Water Framework Directive, within 2015 European Union countries must reach and maintain the "good" Ecological Status (ES), quantified through indices based on key biological elements as indicators. Along the Ligurian shallow rocky coasts (NW Italy), a macroalgae based index (CARtography of LITtoral and upper-sublittoral benthic communities, CARLIT), calibrated according to national characteristics and management needs, has been applied by the Regional Environmental Agency over the last ten years. In 2015, at least a "good" ES was achieved in all Ligurian water bodies except one, located in the Eastern Ligurian coastline, characterized by the lack of the most sensitive species, Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. A general ES improvement has been observed along the Ligurian coastline, also in comparison with other quality indices (macroinvertebrates and fecal bacteria), and in particular in the Genoa water body, as proved by a relevant increase of C. amentacea abundance, probably as a consequence of enhancement in wastewater treatments. In the present study, the reliability of the observed improvement of the ES over a decade has been assessed, teasing apart intra-seasonal and operator-related variability. These results support the reliability of monitoring procedures carried out though the CARLIT Index and highlight the need and the effectiveness of reduction measures for anthropogenic impacts in order to achieve the ES required by European directives.

TI Managing the risk of Hendra virus spillover in Australia using
   ecological approaches: A report on three community juries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   QUEENSLAND; DISEASE; CONSERVATION; GOVERNANCE; INFECTION; VETERINARIANS
AB Background
   Hendra virus (HeV) infection is endemic in Australian flying-fox populations. Habitat loss has increased the peri-urban presence of flying-foxes, increasing the risk of contact and therefore viral 'spillovers' into horse and human populations. An equine vaccine is available and horse-husbandry practices that minimize HeV exposure are encouraged, but their adoption is suboptimal. Ecological approaches-such as habitat creation and conservation-could complement vaccination and behavioural strategies by reducing spillover risks, but these are controversial.
   Methods
   We convened three community juries (two regional; one metropolitan) to elicit the views of well-informed citizens on the acceptability of adding ecological approaches to current interventions for HeV risk. Thirty-one participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited using random-digit-dialling. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence, given time to ask questions of expert presenters and, after deliberation, come to well-reasoned conclusions.
   Results
   All juries voted unanimously that ecological strategies should be included in HeV risk management strategies but concluded that current interventions-including vaccination and changing horse-husbandry practices-must remain the priority. The key reasons given for adopting ecological approaches were: (i) they address underlying drivers of disease emergence, (ii) the potential to prevent spillover of other bat-borne pathogens, and (iii) there would be broader community benefits. Juries differed regarding the best mechanism to create/conserve flying-fox habitat: participants in regional centres favoured direct government action, whereas the metropolitan jury preferred to place the burden on landholders.
   Conclusions
   Informed citizens acknowledge the value of addressing the drivers of bat-borne infectious risks but differ substantially as to the best implementation strategies. Ecological approaches to securing bat habitat could find broad social support in Australia, but disagreement about how best to achieve them indicates the need for negotiation with affected communities to co-develop fair, effective and locally appropriate policies.

AB The velvet belly lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax) is a small deep-sea shark commonly found in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. This bioluminescent species is able to emit a blue-green ventral glow used in counter-illumination camouflage, mainly. In this study, paired-end Illumina HiSeq (TM) technology has been employed to generate transcriptome data from eye and ventral skin tissues of the lanternshark. About 64 and 49 million Illumina reads were generated from skin and eye tissues respectively. The assembly allowed us to predict 119,749 total unigenes including 94,569 for the skin transcriptome and 94,365 for the eye transcriptome while 74,753 were commonly found in both transcriptomes. A taxonomy filtering was applied to extract a reference transcriptome containing 104,390 unigenes among which 38,836 showed significant similarities to known sequences in NCBI non-redundant protein sequences database. Around 58% of the annotated unigenes match with predicted genes from the Elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) genome. The transcriptome completeness has been evaluated by successfully capturing around 98% of orthologous genes of the "Core eukaryotic gene dataset" within the E. spinax reference transcriptome. We identified potential "light-interacting toolkit" genes including multiple genes related to ocular and extraocular light perception processes such as opsins, phototransduction actors or crystallins. Comparative gene expression analysis reveals eye-specific expression of opsins, ciliary phototransduction actors, crystallins and vertebrate retinoid pathway actors. In particular, mRNAs from a single rhodopsin gene and its potentially associated peropsin were detected in the eye transcriptome, only, confirming a monochromatic vision of the lanternshark. Encephalopsin mRNAs were mainly detected in the ventral skin transcriptome. In parallel, immunolocalization of the encephalopsin within the ventral skin of the shark suggests a functional relation with the photophores, i.e. epidermal light-producing organs. We hypothesize that extraocular photoreception might be involved in the bioluminescence control possibly acting on the shutter opening and/or the photocyte activity itself. The newly generated reference transcriptome provides a valuable resource for further understanding of the shark biology.

TI First evaluation of the Next-Generation Sequencing platform for the

AB Introduction
   The WHO urges action against the threat posed by HIV drug resistance. It is well known that the sensitivity of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is greater than that of Sanger Sequencing (SS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the novel NGS HIV-1 drug resistance monitoring system.
   Materials & methods
   NGS analyses were performed on 67 plasma samples from HIV-1 infected patients using the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay from Vela-Dx. This kit was used on a semi-automated Ion Torrent-based platform. Sequences were compared to those obtained by SS. Samples were analysed in the same and in separate runs. Quality controls (QC) were added to control sequencing processes of protease (PRO), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (INT) regions.
   Results
   Of the 41 analysed samples, 33 (80.5%) had identical drug resistance interpretation reports. Discrepant results were observed for eight samples. Five of them were only detected by NGS and had drug resistance mutations (DRMs) with an allelic frequency below the limit of detection of the SS method (between 6.3 to 20.5%). Two DRMs were only identified using the SS method. The sequences were similar in 98.2% of cases (counting variants as mismatches) and homologous in 99.9% if missed variants. Duplicated samples in a single run were similar in 95.7% (99.9%) of cases. Duplicated samples in two different runs were 98% (100%) homologous. QC results were manually assessed with a score of 340/340 for detection of DRMs in PRO and RT and 100% for INT sequencing.
   Conclusions
   This is the first preliminary evaluation in Belgium employing the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay. The NGS appears to be a promising tool for the detection of DRMs in HIV-1 patients and showed a higher sensitivity compared to SS. Large studies assessing the clinical relevance of low frequency DRMs are needed.

AB Eight yeast strains of the genera Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces were screened to ferment high lactose-load cheese whey permeate (CWP) (> 130 g/L lactose) without nutrient supplementation. The fermentation conditions (temperature, pH and time) were optimized to maximize the fermentation performance (ethanol titer, ethanol yield and lactose consumption) for the two preselected strains, K. marxianus DSM 5422 and S. cerevisiae Ethanol Red, using a response surface methodology (RSM). Under optimized conditions, K. marxianus DSM 5422 attained ethanol titers of 6% (v/v) in only 44 h. Moreover, the feasibility of immobilizing this strain on four different inorganic supports (plastic, glass and Tygon silicone Raschig rings and alumina beads) was assessed. Glass Raschig rings and alumina beads showed a more stable performance over time, yielding ethanol titers of 60 g/L during 1,000 hours, which remarkably reduces yeast cultivation costs. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using CWP for successful ethanol production in a simple and economical process, which represents an attractive alternative for waste treatment in dairy industries.

TI Current challenges and proposed solutions to the effective
   implementation of the RTS, S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine Program in sub-Saharan
   Africa: A systematic review
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
ID COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
AB Background
   The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Program, coordinated by the World Health Organization, intended to initiate the roll-out of the RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine in 3 sub-Saharan African countries in 2018. With sub-optimal implementation, the effectiveness of this vaccine in routine clinical use could be significantly lower than its measured efficacy in randomized trials. This study had as objectives to systematically review and summarize published studies addressing the challenges faced during the implementation phase of malaria vaccination programs and randomized trials conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The review also sought to report proposed solutions to the challenges identified.
   Method
   This was a systematic review of studies published between 1947 and 2017. Medline, Embase and the Cochrane library databases were searched. Of the 365 studies retrieved, 8 eligible studies reported on challenges of implementing a malaria vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa and possible solutions to these challenges. Data were abstracted from the eligible studies and a qualitative synthesis was done.
   Results
   The 8 studies included in the review had a total of 6189 participants and used a variety of methodologies (3 qualitative, 1 quantitative, 3 mixed method studies and 1 clinical trial review). There was an overall positive acceptance towards the new malaria vaccine (n = 6/8 studies), with a mean acceptance rate of 86.1% (95% CI: 62.0-110.2, n = 2). The main challenges to vaccine receptivity were: inadequate community engagement due to lack of information about the vaccine (n = 6), fear of the vaccine's side effects (n = 5), inefficient delivery of vaccination services to children (n = 4), and sub-optimal quality of the health services (n = 3). Main themes identified from the proposed solutions consisted of the following: using dynamic communication models and trusted sources for delivering vaccine-related health information to the communities (n = 6), community engagement at both national and district level (n = 6), implementing the new vaccine services alongside the existing health services already delivered (n = 6).
   Conclusion/Recommendations
   Effective implementation of the malaria vaccine program requires careful consideration of the socio-cultural context of each community. The RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine acceptance and uptake may be significantly enhanced if caregivers' perceptions about vaccines and their importance are adequately fine-tuned. In order to achieve these, community participation and the provision of adequate information in an acceptable form via reliable communication channels seem to be imperative.

   and Nutrition Survey
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID ANTE MORAL HAZARD; PROPENSITY-SCORE; IMPACT; COVERAGE; DIFFERENCE;
   SELECTION; MEDICAID; OUTCOMES
AB Background
   Lifestyle choices are important determinants of individual health. Few studies have investigated changes in health behaviors and preventive activities brought about by the 2007 implementation of Urban Resident Basic Health Insurance (URBMI) in China. This study, therefore, aimed to explore whether URBMI has reduced individuals' incentives to adopt healthy behaviors and utilize preventive care services.
   Methods
   Data were drawn from two waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Respondents were categorized according to their insurance situation before and after the URBMI reform in 2006 and 2011. Propensity score matching and difference-in-differences methods were used to measure levels of preventive care and behavior changes over time. Estimations were also made based on gender, self-reported health, and income.
   Results
   We found that URBMI implementation did not change residents' utilization of preventive care services or their smoking habits, drinking habits, or other risky behaviors overall. However, the likelihood of sedentariness did increase by five percentage points. Females tended to be more sedentary while males were less likely to drink soft drinks. Residents with poor self-reported health exercised less while those who reported good health were more likely to be sedentary. Low-and middle-income residents were likely to be sedentary while middle-income people tended to smoke after becoming insured.
   Conclusion
   Since URBMI implementation, some unhealthy behaviors like sedentariness have increased among those who were newly insured, and different subgroups have reacted differently. This suggests that the insurance design needs to be optimized and effective measures need to be adopted to help improve people's lifestyle choices.

AB Background
   Chronic Venous Disease is characterized by morphological abnormalities of the venous system. Affected limbs are classified in increasing clinical severity with the Clinical Etiological Anatomical and Pathological system from C0 to C6. Limbs assessed at C3 through C6 meet the criteria of Chronic Venous Insufficiency. Chronic Venous Insufficiency of the Lower Limbs is a very common pathology affecting approximately similar to 40% of the world's population. This study observes the use of the LivRelief Varicose Vein Cream, a Natural Health Product that is licensed for sale by Health Canada, for use in the treatment of varicose veins.
   Methods
   An open label, single arm interventional, pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of recruitment and data collection in this population. To accomplish this, the cream was provided to all enrolled subjects. Subsequently, objective and subjective measures were performed at baseline and after 6 weeks of at-home use. Recruitment and data collection targets of at least 70% were established and the data collected at both timepoints were compared and analyzed using a paired t-test. Results were also reported as proportions where appropriate.
   Results
   A total of 32 subjects were enrolled. The pre-defined feasibility objectives for recruitment and data collection were met with the enrolment of 97% of all screened patients and the collection of 94% of all scheduled data. The most significant therapeutic improvement was seen in the results of the Venous Clinical Severity Score where 66% of the treated legs experienced a decrease in severity after 6 weeks of treatment. P values were <0.0001 and 0.0003 for the left and right leg, respectively.
   Conclusion
   It is feasible to recruit and collect data with the chosen outcome assessments within this population. Preliminary results suggest that the product could improve some of the clinical symptoms associated with the presence varicose veins. These results warrant further exploration in a longer, randomized and placebo-controlled study.

AB The human-animal relationship can have a major impact on cow welfare and stockpersons' work safety and quality. This cross-sectional study investigated possible effects of stockperson and farm related factors on cows' behaviour towards humans in different test situations on a range of farm types including farms with automatic milking system. On 32 dairy farms, cows' avoidance distances (AD), tolerance to tactile interactions (TTI), behavioural reactions during and after release from restraint (RB) and expressive behaviour by means of qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) were recorded. Multiple regressions were calculated to analyse associations between the cows' responses towards humans and factors of stockpersons' attitudes, factors of human-animal contact and further herd and management characteristics. Positive attitudes towards cows were significantly associated with calmer cows in all test situations. Furthermore, different herd and management factors were related to individual variables of cows' behaviour towards humans: for instance, the percentage of dehorned cows in the herd was associated with more fearful cows; the frequency of human-animal contact, manual feed provision, or selection for docility were associated with calmer cows. Explained variances were highest for the outcome variables AD and QBA. Directly or indirectly all factors remaining in the final models may be related to the amount and quality of human-animal contacts. Thus, the results suggest that on a broad range of different farm types a positive attitude and frequent human-animal contact can contribute to calmer cows in different interactions with humans in the barn.

   CAPACITY; AVIAN PREDATION; TISSUE-DAMAGE; FREE-RADICALS; LIZARD;

AB In animals, color signals that convey information about quality are often associated with costs linked to the expression of coloration and may therefore be honest signals of sender quality. Honest indicators are often seen in sexual signals that are used by males to advertise quality to females. Carotenoid and pterin pigments are responsible for yellow, orange, and red coloration in a variety of taxa, but can also serve important roles as antioxidants by reducing free radicals in the body. In this study, we test the effects of a novel full-bodied orange color phenotype of the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, on mate choice, physiology, and survival. We found no evidence that lizards expressing the orange phenotype were preferred by females. Additionally, they did not differ in immune function, running endurance, or maximum sprint speed from lizards that did not express the novel phenotype. Pigment extractions revealed that orange body coloration resulted from pterin pigments and not carotenoids. Visual models suggest that the orange phenotype is less conspicuous to bird predators than the brown phenotype and may provide an adaptive explanation for the persistence of this trait. Given its small, yet positive effect on fitness, we expect the orange color phenotype to increase in frequency in subsequent decades.

AB Ambient noise can affect the availability of acoustic information to animals, altering both foraging and vigilance behaviour. Using captive zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, we examined the effect of ambient broadband noise on foraging decisions. Birds were given a choice between foraging in a quiet area where conspecific calls could be heard or a noisy area where these calls would be masked. Birds foraging in noisy areas spent a significantly more time vigilant than those in quiet areas, resulting in less efficient foraging. Despite this there was no significant difference in the amount of time spent in the two noise regimes. However there did appear a preference for initially choosing quiet patches during individuals' second trial. These results emphasise how masking noise can influence the foraging and anti-predation behaviour of animals, which is particularly relevant as anthropogenic noise becomes increasingly prevalent in the natural world.

AB Carbamylation is a post-translational modification that mostly affects proteins with low turnover, such as dermal proteins. Carbamylated proteins accumulate in skin in an age-dependent manner, contributing to tissue alterations. As dermis is affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc) and anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP Ab) are found in SSc patients, we sought to evaluate the specificity of anti-CarP Ab and their relationship with clinical parameters reflecting skin involvement in SSc. This study investigated serum samples and clinical data from 124 patients with SSc. Anti-CarP Ab were affinity purified from pooled SSc sera, and their specificity was assessed by western blotting and ELISA with carbamylated proteins from two species (human and bovine albumin; human fibrinogen). Anti-CarP Ab were measured in SSc serum samples and in 41 healthy aged-matched individuals. Affinity-purified anti-CarP Ab recognized carbamylated epitopes irrespective of the protein type or species origin. Anti-CarP Ab levels inversely correlated with the modified Rodnan skin score (mRss) (Spearman's R = -0.32, p<0.001), independently of patients' age. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis identified anti-CarP Ab cut-offs that best discriminated dichotomized clinical variables related to skin involvement: the only clinical variables that were significantly different between groups were mRss (p = 0.001) and scleredema (p<0.001). Low anti-CarP Ab levels were associated with worse skin involvement. Future prospective studies are needed to assess their usefulness in the clinical setting.

TI Electronic cigarette power affects count concentration and particle size
   distribution of vaping aerosol

   MAINSTREAM; PARAMETERS; SMOKE
AB Introduction
   Electronic cigarettes (EC) have evolved rapidly toward higher powered devices that produce more vaping aerosol and a more satisfying vaping experience. This research characterized the particle size distribution and estimated the mass concentration of vaping aerosols produced at power outputs spanning the operating range typical of second generation variable voltage EC devices.
   Methods
   EC aerosol was characterized from a single coil atomizer powered by a variable voltage EC battery at the minimum and maximum dial settings (3.3, 11.2 Watts, W), and a lab controlled power supply (3-11.9 W). Aerosol particle size distribution was measured by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer and Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, spanning 16 nm to 19.8 mu m. A mouth puff was simulated using a 100 mL glass syringe.
   Results
   Consistent with prior studies, sub-micron EC aerosol size distributions were bimodal, with peaks at 40 and 200 nm, however a previously unreported third mode was observed at approximately 1000 nm. The similar to 1000 nm mode accounted for 7-20x the aerosol mass of the smaller modes. Increasing atomizer power decreased count concentration of particles <600 nm but increased particle count >600 nm. Particle mass distribution shifted toward micron sized particles with increasing power and increased the respirable fraction of aerosol, likely due to increased coagulation and condensation around nano-sized particles.
   Conclusions
   Vaping power greatly affects EC aerosol count and mass distribution. Mouth puffed EC aerosol spans a much wider particle size range than previously reported, although the major portion of the mass is still well within the alveolar size range the larger particles will deposit within the oro-pharyngeal cavity at 2-3x greater efficiency than in alveoli. These observations have major clinical implications, as aerosol particle size distribution determines deposition sites along the respiratory tract. The results of this experiment stress the need for further research to inform the design, regulation and use of e-cigarette products.

AB Mate choice is an important process in sexual selection and usually prevents inbreeding depression in populations. In the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare, the close physical proximity between individuals may increase the risk of reproducing with siblings. Moreover, individuals of this species can be infected with the feminizing bacteria of Wolbachia, which influence male mate choice. However, little is known about the kinship or familiarity assessment of the selected partner that occurs when a male can choose between females with or without Wolbachia. To investigate the potential mechanisms leading to mate choice and the potential impact of the parasite, we performed behavioral choice tests on males where they could choose between sibling vs. nonsibling females, familiar vs. unfamiliar females, and sibling familiar vs. unfamiliar nonsibling females. To investigate the costs of inbreeding, we compared the reproductive success of both sibling and nonsibling mates. Our results revealed that male copulation attempts were higher for familiar females and for nonsibling females when both females were Wolbachia-infected, but the duration was longer when both females were Wolbachia-free. When males mated with a sibling female, their fecundity was severely decreased, consistent with inbreeding depression. Overall, we observed copulations with all types of females and demonstrated discrimination capacities and potential preferences. We highlight the complexity of the tradeoff between kinship, familiarity and parasite transmission assessment for mate choice.

AB Otolith strontium and multi-year mark-recapture information were used to characterize associations between migration patterns and spawning frequencies in an anadromous Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) population (Rat River, Northwest Territories, Canada) that undertakes a long migration between freshwater spawning/overwintering (Fish Creek; a tributary to Rat River) and marine feeding habitats (Beaufort Sea) (similar to 800 km round trip). Reconstructions of lifetime annual migration histories among otolith annuli was matched to information on reproductive status (current-year 'spawner' or 'non-spawner') that was known in two different, sometimes successive, years for each fish. Two migratory life histories were observed: fish either migrated annually after smoltification or periodically skipped an annual ocean migration to remain in freshwater and spawn. Different spawning frequencies were detected where fish not migrating annually tended to spawn in alternate years (84.6%) more often than those migrating annually (50%). Additionally, annually migrating fish had lower longevity (<= 9 years vs. <= 13 years). The evaluation of differences in spawning frequency between sexes, independent of migration tactic, revealed males (84.6%) skipped spawning more often than females (51.2%) suggesting fitness trade-offs between life histories differ between sexes. Further, some fish returned from the sea considerably earlier than the majority of other current-year migrants. Our findings demonstrate intrapopulation diversity in migration behaviour and reproductive frequency.

   PREVENTION; PREGNANCY; DECIDUA; TERM
AB Objective
   To determine the effect of intramuscular progesterone on the vaginal immune response of pregnant women with a history of prior preterm birth.
   Methods
   A prospective, cohort study of women at 11-16 weeks gestation, >= 18 years of age, and carrying a singleton pregnancy was conducted from June 2016 to August 2017 after IRB approval. Women in the progesterone arm had a history of preterm birth and received weekly intramuscular 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Controls comprised of women with healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies. Excluded were women with vaginitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or other chronic diseases affecting the immune response. A vaginal wash was performed at enrollment, at 26-28 weeks, and at 35-36 weeks gestation. Samples underwent semi-quantitative detection of human inflammatory markers. Immunofluorescence pixel density data was analyzed and a P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results
   here were 39 women included, 10 with a prior preterm birth and 29 controls. The baseline demographics and pregnancy outcomes for both groups were similar in age, parity, race, BMI, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, and birth weight. Enrollment cytokines in women with a prior preterm birth, including IL-1 alpha (39.2 +/- 25.1% versus 26.1 +/- 13.2%; P = 0.04), IL-1 beta (47.9 +/- 26.4% versus 24.9 +/- 17%; P<0.01), IL-2 (16.7 +/- 9.3% versus 11.3 +/- 6.3%; P = 0.03), and IL-13 (16.9 +/- 12.4% versus 8.2 +/- 7.4%; P = 0.01) were significantly elevated compared to controls. In the third trimester the cytokine densities for IL-1 alpha (26.0 +/- 18.2% versus 22.3 +/- 12.0%; P = 0.49), IL-1 beta (31.8 +/- 15.9% versus 33.1 +/- 16.8%; P = 0.84), IL-2 (10.0 +/- 8.4% versus 10.9 +/- 5.9%; P = 0.71), and IL-13 (9.1 +/- 5.9% versus 10.0 +/- 6.5%; P = 0.71) were all statistically similar between the progesterone arm and controls, respectively.
   Conclusion
   There is an increased cytokine presence in vaginal washings of women at risk for preterm birth which appears to be modified following the administration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate to levels similar to healthy controls.

AB This is the first review of the evidence, based on longitudinal studies in the United Kingdom, on the association of ill health at any life stage and later social and economic outcomes. The review included a wide range of physical and mental health exposures, both self-reported and objectively measured, as well as social (e.g. life satisfaction) and economic (e.g. employment) outcomes. We searched the Web of Science, key longitudinal datasets based in the UK, major economic journals, Google Scholar and reference lists of relevant publications. The review includes 80 studies. There was strong evidence for the association between early mental health, mainly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and lifetime educational, occupational and various social outcomes. Also, both poor physical and mental health in early and middle adulthood, tended to be associated with unemployment and lower socioeconomic status. Among older adults, the evidence quite consistently indicated an association between mental health, chronic conditions, disability/functional limitations, self-rated general health and quality of life, life satisfaction and early retirement. Overall, mental health was consistently found to be associated with a range of social and economic outcomes throughout the lifespan. The evidence for the association between physical health and later outcomes is more inconsistent. A number of methodological challenges need to be addressed, particularly related to causal inference, to produce robust evidence with potential to inform public health policy.

TI Participant concerns for the Learner in a Virtual Reality replication of
   the Milgram obedience study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENT TECHNOLOGY; PARADIGM; TOOL
AB In Milgram's seminal obedience studies, participants' behaviour has traditionally been explained as a demonstration of people's tendency to enter into an 'agentic state' when in the presence of an authority figure: they attend only to the demands of that authority and are insensitive to the plight of their victims. There have been many criticisms of this view, but most rely on either indirect or anecdotal evidence. In this study, participants (n = 40) are taken through a Virtual Reality simulation of the Milgram paradigm. Compared to control participants (n = 20) who are not taken through the simulation, those in the experimental conditions are found to attempt to help the Learner more by putting greater emphasis on the correct word over the incorrect words. We also manipulate the extent to which participants identify with the science of the study and show that high identifiers both give more help, are less stressed, and are more hesitant to press the shock button than low identifiers. We conclude that these findings constitute a refutation of the 'agentic state' approach to obedience. Instead, we discuss implications for the alternative approaches such as 'engaged follower-ship' which suggests that obedience is a function of relative identification with the science and with the victim in the study. Finally, we discuss the value of Virtual Reality as a technique for investigating hard-to-study psychological phenomena.

   MELANIZATION; VIRULENCE; EVOLUTION; IDENTIFICATION
AB Pigments and phytotoxins are crucial for the survival and spread of plant pathogenic fungi. The genome of the tomato biotrophic fungal pathogen Cladosporium fulvum contains a predicted gene cluster (CfPKS1, CfPRF1, CfRDT1 and CfTSF1) that is syntenic with the characterized elsinochrome toxin gene cluster in the citrus pathogen Elsinoe fawcettii. However, a previous phylogenetic analysis suggested that CfPks1 might instead be involved in pigment production. Here, we report the characterization of the CfPKS1 gene cluster to resolve this ambiguity. Activation of the regulator CfTSF1 specifically induced the expression of CfPKS1 and CfRDT1, but not of CfPRF1. These co-regulated genes that define the CfPKS1 gene cluster are orthologous to genes involved in 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthesis in other fungi. Heterologous expression of CfPKS1 in Aspergillus oryzae yielded 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, a typical precursor of DHN melanin. Delta cfpks1 deletion mutants showed similar altered pigmentation to wild type treated with DHN melanin inhibitors. These mutants remained virulent on tomato, showing this gene cluster is not involved in pathogenicity. Altogether, our results showed that the CfPKS1 gene cluster is involved in the production of DHN melanin and suggests that elsinochrome production in E. fawcettii likely involves another gene cluster.

ID OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; VARIABILITY; EFFICIENCY; REPRODUCIBILITY;
   CALIBRATOR; ACCURACY
AB Purpose
   This study aimed to examine the validity, reliability and minimum detectable change (MDC) of the Cosmed K5 in breath by breath (BxB) mode, against VacuMed metabolic simulator. Intra and inter-units reliability was also assessed.
   Methods
   Fourteen metabolic rates (from 0.9 to 4 L.min-1) were reproduced by a VacuMed system and pulmonary ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured by two different K5 units. Validity was assessed by ordinary least products (OLP) regression analysis, Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), mean percentage differences, technical errors (TE) and MDC for VE, VO2, and VCO2. Intra- and inter-K5 reliability was evaluated by absolute percentage differences between measurements (MAPE), ICCs, TE, and MDC.
   Results
   Validity analysis from OLP regression data and Bland-Altman plots indicated high agreement between K5 and simulator. ICC values were excellent for all variables (>0.99). Mean percentage differences in VE (-0.50%, p = 0.11), VO2 (-0.04%, p = 0.80), and VCO2 (- 1.03%, p = 0.09) showed no significant bias. The technical error (TE) ranged from 0.73% to 1.34% (VE and VCO2 respectively). MDC were lower than 4% (VE = 2.0%, VO2 = 3.8%, VCO2 = 3.7%). The intra and inter K5 reliability assessment reveled excellent ICCs (>0.99), MAPE <2% (no significant differences between trials), TE < or around 1%, MDC < or around 3%.
   Conclusions
   K5 in BxB mode is a valid and reliable system for metabolic measurements. This is the first study assessing the MDC accounting only for technical variability reporting intra- and inter-units MDCs < 3.3%.

AB Ghost crabs have been widely used as a bio-indicator species of human impacts on sandy beaches to obtain reliable biological data for management and conservation purposes. Ghost crab population densities and individual sizes decline dramatically under human pressure. However, distribution within a beach and the factors that determine this distribution of ghost crabs is still an open question. These factors may provide valuable information for understanding human impacts on sandy beaches. Here we examine ghost crab burrows on 20 sandy beaches of South Carolina, USA under various levels of human impacts to understand the response in terms of spatial distribution of this species to human impacts. We also examine the burrow characteristics and environmental properties of the burrows to determine whether these factors alter burrow characteristics. We show that crabs on heavily impacted beaches altered their spatial distribution to mostly occupy the edges of impacted beaches. Further, this change in spatial distribution was influenced by the size distribution of the population on a beach (i.e. larger individuals occupy upper parts on the beaches). We also found that ghost crabs altered the morphology of their burrows on heavily impacted beaches. Ghost crabs create deeper, steeper and smaller burrows under human impacts. These patterns were also influenced by physical characteristics of the beach. Our results suggest that human impacts can directly influence the spatial distribution of ghost crab populations within a beach and therefore sampling at upper parts of the beaches overestimates the population density and individual sizes. Our results support the use of ghost crabs as indicator species in effective beach management, but suggest that assessments would benefit from examining the morphology and distribution of burrows as opposed to simply using burrow counts to assess the health of sandy shores.

AB Background
   The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of exercise cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (RTOF) and to assess right and left ventricular adaptation and aortic wall response to exercise in comparison with volunteers.
   Methods
   11 RTOF and 11 volunteers underwent prospective CMR at rest and during exercise. A supine bicycle ergometer was employed to reach twice the resting heart rate during continuous exercise, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. Bi-ventricular parameters and aortic stiffness were assessed using accelerated cine sequences and flow-encoding CMR. A t-test was used to compare values between groups. A Mann Whitney test was used to compare values within groups.
   Results
   In RTOF both ventricles showed an impaired contractile reserve (RVEF rest 36.2 +/- 8.3%, +1.3 +/- 3.9% increase after exercise; LVEF rest 53.8 +/- 6.1%, +5.7 +/- 6.4% increase after exercise) compared to volunteers (RVEF rest 50.5 +/- 5.0%, +10.4 +/- 7.1% increase after exercise, p = 0.039; LVEF rest 61.9 +/- 3.1%, +12.2 +/- 4.7% increase after exercise, p = 0.014).
   RTOF showed a reduced distensibility of the ascending aorta during exercise compared to volunteers (RTOF: 3.4 +/- 1.9 10-3.mmHg(-1)vs volunteers: 5.1 +/- 1.4 10-3.mmHg(-1); p = 0.027). Ascending aorta distensibility was correlated to cardiac work in the volunteers but not in RTOF.
   Conclusion
   RTOF showed an impaired contractile reserve for both ventricles. The exercise unmasked a reduced distensibility of the ascending aorta in RTOF, which may be an early sign of increased aortic rigidity.

TI TP53 p.Arg337His germline mutation prevalence in Southern Brazil:
   Further evidence for mutation testing in young breast cancer patients
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID POPULATION; P.R337H; IMPLEMENTATION; CARRIERS; PROGRAM; R337H
AB Premenopausal breast cancer (BC) is a core tumor of Li-Fraumeni (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) Syndromes, predisposition disorders caused by germline mutations in TP53 gene. In the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil, a specific TP53 germline mutation, c.1010G>A (p.Arg337His), was identified at a population frequency of 0.3%, the highest value ever described for a TP53 germline variation. In Brazilian BC patients, carrier frequency can vary from 0.5% to 8.7%. The current study assessed carrier frequency by genotyping TP53 c.1010G>A in 2 BC groups: 1) 315 patients unselected for age of diagnosis and family history (FH) and 2) 239 patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. One carrier was identified in group 1 (0.3%; CI 95% 0.1-1.76%) and six carriers in group 2 (2.5%; CI 95% 0.93-5.39%). The frequencies differed significantly between groups (p = 0.04). The mutation carrier frequency observed in group 2 could justify mutation testing in BC patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. Further studies in larger samples of BC patients of different ages and regions of the country are necessary to provide more definitive TP53 p.Arg337His carrier frequencies in different scenarios.

AB Purpose
   The study purpose was to investigate the acceptability and utility of, and preference for, wearable activity trackers (WATs) amongst cancer survivors living in regional and remote areas of Western Australia.
   Methods
   Twenty participants were recruited (Mean age = 63 years, SD = 13) to test two to three trackers from five available models (Fitbit Alta, Garmin Vivofit 2, Garmin Vivosmart, Polar loop 2 and Polar A300). Participants wore each device for two weeks, followed by a one-week washout period between devices. Interviews were conducted with participants to explore user perceptions and experiences. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   Four main themes emerged: (i) Consciousness raising; (ii) Prompts and Feedback; (iii) Accuracy and registry of activities; and, (iv) WAT preferences and features.
   Conclusions
   WATs were acceptable and useful to cancer survivors. WATs increased self-awareness of physical activity, provided real time feedback in relation to step goals, and reinforced progress and efforts towards goals. The aesthetics of the WATs were deemed crucial in determining preference and likelihood of use.
   Implications for cancer survivors
   Future interventions may do well to have two different WATs available for participants to choose from, according to activity preferences, aesthetic preferences, and display size.

AB Agriculture is undergoing important changes in order to meet sustainable soil management with respect to biodiversity (namely agroecology). Within this context, alternative solutions to mineral fertilizers such as agricultural biostimulants are thus promoted and being developed. The mechanisms by which some soil biostimulants sustain soil biological functioning and indirectly increase crop yields are still unknown. Our goal in the present study was to demonstrate if and to what extent the application of a soil biostimulant affects the soil heterotrophic microbial communities that are involved in organic matter decomposition and carbon mineralization. We hypothesized that the addition of a biostimulant results in changes in the composition and in the biomass of soil microbial communities. This in turn increases the mineralization of the organic matter derived from crop residues. We performed soil microcosm experiments with the addition of crop residues and a biostimulant, and we monitored the organic carbon (orgC) mineralization and the microbial biomass, along with the microbial community composition by sequencing 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicons. The addition of a soil biostimulant caused a pH neutralizing effect and simultaneous enhancement of the orgC mineralization of crop residues (+ 400 mu g orgC g(-1) dry soil) and microbial biomass (+ 60 mu g orgC g(-1) dry soil) that were linked to changes in the soil microbial communities. Our findings suggest that the soil carbon mineralization enhancement in the presence of the biostimulant was supported by the specific recruitment of soil bacteria and fungi. Whereas archaea remained stable, several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of indigenous soil bacteria and fungi were enriched and affiliated with known microbial decomposers such as Cytophagaceae, Phaselicystis sp., Verrucomicrobia, Pseudomonas sp., Ramicandelaber sp., and Mortierella sp., resulting in lower soil microbial richness and diversity.

TI Delay in treatment initiation and treatment outcomes among adult
   patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at Yangon Regional
   Tuberculosis Centre, Myanmar: A retrospective study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREDICTORS
AB Background
   Myanmar faces a health security threat, with an increasing number of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. Long delays in the initiation of treatment are a barrier to MDR-TB control.
   Objectives
   The main objectives of this study were (1) to identify the determinants of delay in treatment initiation after MDR-TB diagnosis, and (2) to explore the effects of treatment delay on disease infectivity, severity, treatment adherence, and treatment outcomes.
   Methods
   This retrospective study reviewed 330 MDR-TB treatment cards for patients enrolled for treatment at Yangon Regional Tuberculosis Centre, in 2014.
   Results
   Median treatment delay was 105 days, interquartile range (IQR) 106 (61-167) days; (51.5%) of patients experienced a long treatment delay (>= 105 days). Regarding the determinants of treatment delay, this study identified important patient-healthcare system interaction factors. Significant risk factors of long treatment delay included female sex, age > 30 years, and prior contact with patients with MDR-TB. Patients with long treatment delays were significantly different from those with short delays, in terms of having high sputum smear grade, resistance to more than two main drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin), and long culture conversion time. In this study, delay in the initiation of treatment was associated with poor treatment outcome, but this was not statistically significant after adjusting for other risk factors. Median treatment-delay times were longer among patients with poor outcomes (144 days) than those with successful outcomes (102 days).
   Conclusions
   Post-diagnosis delays in the initiation of treatment among MDR-TB patients were significantly long. The study results showed that inadequate MDR-TB treatment initiation center, centralization of treatment initiation, limitation of human resources, were health-system factors delaying timely treatment initiation and implementation of an effective TB-control program. Our findings highlight the need for immediate interventions to reduce treatment delay and improve treatment outcomes, including scaling up diagnostic capacity with Xpert MTB/RIF at township level, expansion of decentralized MDR-TB treatment initiation centers, ensuring a productive health workforce comprising trained health personnel, and providing health education and treatment-adherence counseling to patients and family members.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PARAPAPILLARY CHORIORETINAL ATROPHY; DISC ROTATION; POPULATION;
   PREVALENCE; DAMAGE; RISK; SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB Purpose
   To investigate the relationship between the morphologic features of myopic optic nerve head (ONH) and visual field (VF) defects in myopic subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) by intraindividual comparison.
   Methods
   Myopic POAG subjects with unilateral glaucomatous VF defect were recruited. The morphologic features of myopic ONH, including optic disc tilt, optic disc rotation, and beta-zone parapapillary atrophy (PPA) were measured from color fundus photographs. The comparisons were performed between the eyes with VF defects and the contralateral eyes without VF defects. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between various ocular parameters and the presence of VF defects.
   Results
   We retrospectively included 100 eyes of 50 myopic POAG subjects. (Mean age: 50.1 +/- 10.0 years). The tilt ratio was similar between the paired eyes. The degree of optic disc rotation (12.96 +/- 7.21 degrees) in eyes with VF defects were statistically greater than the contralateral eyes (6.86 +/- 4.30 degrees; P < 0.001) without VF defect. The beta-zone PPA-to-disc area ratio was significantly greater in eyes with VF defects than the contralateral eyes (P = 0.024) without VF defect. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the greater degree of optic disc rotation was significantly associated with the presence of VF defects (P < 0.001). However, tilt ratio, beta-zone PPA-to-disc area ratio, refractive error, and axial length were not associated with the presence of VF defects.
   Conclusions
   Among the morphologic features of myopic ONH, only the greater degree of the optic disc rotation was associated with the presence of VF defects in myopic subjects with POAG.

TI Diagnostic value of tumor-fascia relationship in superficial soft tissue
   masses on magnetic resonance imaging
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BENIGN; MRI; SARCOMAS; DEPTH; SIZE; BONE
AB Purpose
   Many surgeons participate in the management of superficial soft tissue masses, and a pre-operative incorrect diagnosis frequently results in dismal oncological outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify distinguishing magnetic resonance imaging features between malignant and non-malignant lesions.
   Methods
   The clinicopathological data for 219 patients (men 114; women 105) with superficial soft tissue masses treated from January 2007 to December 2016 in our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The median age at the first visit was 55.6 years (range 1-90 years). MRI findings of tumor size, margin, lobulation, intratumoral hemorrhage, peritumoral edema, and tumor-fascia relationship were compared with the final histological diagnosis and tumor grade.
   Results
   Univariate analysis revealed significant relationships between histologically malignant lesions and tumor size >= 5 cm (p = 0.035), positive peritumoral edema (p = 0.031), and tumor-fascia relationship (p<0.001), but not margin (p = 0.107), lobulation (p = 0.071), and intratumoral hemorrhage (p = 0.17). In addition, using multivariate analysis, the tumor-fascia relationship (p<0.001) and tumor size were significant factors.
   A significant correlation between tumor-fascia relationship and malignancy (p<0.001) was observed; such a relationship was, however, not observed for tumor grade (p = 0.43).
   Conclusions
   Tumors measuring >= 5 cm and the tumor-fascia relationship on magnetic resonance imaging are highly indicative of malignancy. When superficial soft tissue masses cross the superficial fascia and form obtuse angles with the fascia, sarcoma should be considered. The tumor-fascia relationship can offer surgeons useful information regarding the status of superficial soft tissue masses.

AB Behaviors characterized as restricted and repetitive (RRBs) in autism manifest in diverse ways, from motor mannerisms to intense interests, and are diagnostically defined as interfering with functioning. A variety of early autism interventions target RRBs as preoccupying young autistic children to the detriment of exploration and learning opportunities. In an exploratory study, we developed a novel stimulating play situation including objects of potential interest to autistic children, then investigated repetitive behaviors and object explorations in 49 autistic and 43 age-matched typical young children (20-69 months). Autistic children displayed significantly increased overall frequency and duration of repetitive behaviors, as well as increased specific repetitive behaviors. However, groups did not significantly differ in frequency and duration of overall object explorations, in number of different objects explored, or in explorations of specific objects. Exploratory analyses found similar or greater exploration of literacy-related objects in autistic compared to typical children. Correlations between repetitive behaviors and object explorations (their frequency and duration) revealed positive, not negative, associations in both groups. Our findings, from a novel situation incorporating potential autistic interests, suggest that RRBs do not necessarily displace exploration and its possibilities for learning in autism.

AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) generates large amounts of complete and incomplete viral particles. Except for the virion, which acts as infectious particles, the function of those particles remains elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been revealed to have biological functions. The EVs which size are less than 100 nm in diameter, were collected from HBV infected-patients. These vesicles contain, complete and incomplete virions, and exosomes, which have been recently shown to be critical as intercellular communicators. Here, the effects of the exosome, the complete, and the incomplete particles on the target cells were investigated. These particles are endocytosed by monocyte/macrophages and function primarily to upregulate PD-L1. The functions and composition of the EVs were affected by nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), suggesting that the EVs are involved in the pathogenesis of HBV hepatitis and clinical course of those patients treated by NRTIs.

TI Mapping the global potential distributions of two arboviral vectors
   Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus under changing climate
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   VIRUS; MOSQUITOS; PATTERNS; POPULATIONS; PERFORMANCE
AB Background
   Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the primary vectors that transmit several arboviral diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The world is presently experiencing a series of outbreaks of these diseases, so, we still require to better understand the current distributions and possible future shifts of their vectors for successful surveillance and control programs. Few studies assessed the influences of climate change on the spatial distributional patterns and abundance of these important vectors, particularly using the most recent climatic scenarios. Here, we updated the current potential distributions of both vectors and assessed their distributional changes under future climate conditions.
   Methods
   We used ecological niche modeling approach to estimate the potential distributions of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus under present-day and future climate conditions. This approach fits ecological niche model from occurrence records of each species and environmental variables. For each species, future projections were based on climatic data from 9 general circulation models (GCMs) for each representative concentration pathway (RCP) in each time period, with a total of 72 combinations in four RCPs in 2050 and 2070. All ENMs were tested using the partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) and a set of 2,048 and 2,003 additional independent records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Finally, we used background similarity test to assess the similarity between the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.
   Results
   The predicted potential distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus coincided with the current and historical known distributions of both species. Aedes aegypti showed a markedly broader distributional potential across tropical and subtropical regions than Ae. albopictus. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus was markedly broader in distributional potential across temperate Europe and the United States. All ecological niche models (ENMs) were statistically robust (P < 0.001). ENMs successfully anticipated 98% (1,999/2,048) and 99% (1,985/2,003) of additional independent records for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively (P < 0.001). ENMs based on future conditions showed similarity between the overall distributional patterns of future-day and present-day conditions; however, there was a northern range expansion in the continental USA to include parts of Southern Canada in case of Ae. albopictus in both 2050 and 2070. Future models also anticipated further expansion of Ae. albopictus to the East to include most of Europe in both time periods. Aedes aegypti was anticipated to expand to the South in East Australia in 2050 and 2070. The predictions showed differences in distributional potential of both species between diverse RCPs in 2050 and 2070. Finally, the background similarity test comparing the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was unable to reject the null hypothesis of niche similarity between both species (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion
   These updated maps provided details to better guide surveillance and control programs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. They have also significant public health importance as a baseline for predicting the emergence of arboviral diseases transmitted by both vectors in new areas across the world.

TI Inflammasome proteins as biomarkers of traumatic brain injury
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; ACTIVATION; HYPOTHERMIA;
   MICROGLIA
AB Background
   The inflammasome plays an important role in the inflammatory innate immune response after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Inhibition of the inflammasome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in improved outcomes by lowering the levels of caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1b. We have previously shown that inflammasome proteins are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with TBI and that higher levels of these proteins were consistent with poorer outcomes after TBI when compared to patients that presented these inflammasome proteins at lower levels.
   Methods and findings
   Here we extend our work by analyzing serum from 21 TBI patients and CSF from 18 TBI patients compared to 120 serum samples and 30 CSF samples from no-TBI donor controls for the expression of caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), interleukin(IL)-1b and IL-18. Analysis was carried out using the Ella Simple Plex system (Protein Simple) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of inflammasome proteins as biomarkers of TBI. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, confidence intervals and likelihood ratios for each biomarker was determined. ROC curves, confidence intervals, sensitivity and specificity for each biomarker examined revealed that caspase-1 (0.93 area under the curve (AUC)) and ASC (0.90 AUC) in serum and ASC (1.0 AUC) and IL-18 (0.84 AUC) in CSF are promising biomarkers of TBI pathology. Importantly, higher protein levels (above 547.6 pg/ml) of ASC (0.91 AUC) were consistent with poorer outcomes after TBI as determined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE).
   Conclusion
   These findings indicate that inflammasome proteins are excellent diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of TBI.

AB Recently, modulation of gut microbiota by probiotics treatment has been emerged as a promising strategy for treatment of metabolic disorders. Apart from lactic acid bacteria, Bacillus species (Bacillus spp.) have also been paid attention as potential probiotics, but nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms for their protective effect against metabolic dysfunction remain to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that a probiotic mixture composed of 5 different Bacillus spp. protects mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Probiotic Bacillus treatment substantially attenuated body weight gain and enhanced glucose tolerance by sensitizing insulin action in skeletal muscle and epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) of HFD-fed mice. Bacillus-treated HFD-fed mice also exhibited significantly suppressed chronic inflammation in the liver, EAT and skeletal muscle, which was observed to be associated with reduced HFD-induced intestinal permeability and enhanced adiponectin production. Additionally, Bacillus treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. In Bacillus-treated mice, hepatic expression of lipid oxidative genes was significantly increased, and lipid accumulation in subcutaneous and mesenteric adipose tissues were significantly decreased, commensurate with down-regulated expression of genes involved in lipid uptake and lipogenesis. Although, in Bacillus-treated mice, significant alterations in gut microbiota composition was not observed, the enhanced expression of tight junction-associated proteins showed a possibility of improving gut barrier function by Bacillus treatment. Our findings provide possible explanations how Bacillus probiotics protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic disorders, identifying the treatment of probiotic Bacillus as a potential therapeutic approach.

AB An anesthetic protocol was optimized for microinjection-related handling of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii; Acipenseriformes) prolarvae, an extant primitive fish species commonly grown in aquaculture. Comparative examinations of three selected anesthetics (clove oil, lidocaine, and MS-222) with a dosage regime of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L indicated that MS-222 was the most efficient agent for Siberian sturgeon prolarvae, as evidenced by the fast induction of anesthesia with quick and uniform recovery. Meanwhile, clove oil should be avoided, due to prolonged recovery times varying widely between individuals. None of the tested anesthetics significantly affected prolarval viability at any of the dosage regimes tested in this study. Based on an analysis of the duration of an unconscious state in air, we recommend a dose of 200 mg/L MS-222 for microinjection. Recovery time after use of this dose was influenced by the prolarval age and the development of gills, in which prolarvae older than 3 days after hatching required longer recovery times than did younger prolarvae. Post-recovery behavioral assessment showed no apparent difference between MS-222-anesthetized and non-anesthetized prolarvae in their swimming behavior and phototactic responses. Applicability of currently developed anesthetic protocol using MS-222 in larval microinjection was demonstrated with the injection of a visible dye to the anesthetized prolarvae, followed by the analysis of post-recovery viability. Taken together, the present anesthetic protocol based on 200 mg/L of MS-222 could provide researchers with practical usefulness with good safety margins for the micromanipulation and other related handlings of Siberian sturgeon prolarvae.

AB We analyzed treatment outcomes and prognostic factors in adult patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) to select patients who would be benefited by active anticancer treatment. After excluding 18 patients who received palliative care only and 13 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, 72 t-MN patients (45 with acute myeloid leukemia and 27 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 10 (13.9%), 32 (44.4%), and 30 patients (41.7%) had favorable, intermediate-and adverse-risk cytogenetics, respectively. Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, patients with a normal karyotype (NK; N = 20) showed superior allogeneic stem cell transplantation-censored overall survival (AC-OS) and OS compared to those with non-NK-intermediate-risk cytogenetics (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, male sex, age >= 70 years, and unfavorable cytogenetics (non-NK-intermediate plus adverse risk cytogenetics) were associated with inferior AC-OS. Those results suggest that a more-refined subdivision of risk stratification would be necessary in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between use of antimicrobials, such as fluoroquinolone, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime, and Escherichia coli resistance using a nationwide database. Nationwide data on antimicrobial consumption for 12 years (2002 to 2013) were acquired from a database of subjects (n = 1,025,340) included in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. National antimicrobial resistance rates of E. coli were obtained from the Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, which has been administered by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2002. Fluoroquinolone-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals have continuously increased since 2002 and were correlated with nationwide fluoroquinolone use (r = 0.82, P = 0.0012) or ciprofloxacin use (r = 0.90, P<0.0001). Cefotaxime-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals markedly increased since 2008 and were correlated with nationwide cefotaxime use (r = 0.94, P<0.0001) or third-generation cephalosporin use (r = 0.96, P<0.0001). Cefoxitin-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals peaked in 2010 and significantly correlated with cephamycin use at a two-year interval (r = 0.64, P = 0.0256). In conclusion, consumption of antimicrobials such as fluoroquinolone, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime is well correlated with the resistance rates of E. coli to these agents. This study provides background data for national antimicrobial management policies to reduce antimicrobial resistance.

TI The impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on socioeconomic inequality in
   health care services utilization
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCESS; DISPARITIES; BARRIERS; VISIT
AB Objective
   We examined whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion reduced socioeconomic inequalities in health care utilization.
   Methods
   We used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, covering the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, between 2011 and 2016. We selected outcome indicators, viz. ability to afford needed health care, having a personal doctor, use of health services in the past year (routine check-up, flu shot and dental visits), and attending screenings for breast, cervical, and colon cancers. Socioeconomic status was measured by household income. We calculated two indices of inequality by household income for each outcome: Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). We estimated difference-in-differences models to examine the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on socioeconomic inequality in use of health care services.
   Results
   The ACA Medicaid expansion appeared to reduce the socioeconomic gap in individuals reporting financial ability in accessing health care (difference-in-differences estimators, -0.045 for SII and RII), having a personal doctor (-0.037 for SII and RII), and receiving routine check-ups (-0.027 for SII and -0.039 for RII). However, the expansion was not associated with reduction in the socioeconomic gap for preventive health care visits or dental care.
   Conclusions
   The ACA Medicaid expansion had mixed effects on socioeconomic disparities in health care utilization. Medicaid expansion may not be sufficient to address socioeconomic disparities in preventive services uptake.

TI Blockade of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, not
   receptor-alpha ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IMATINIB; FIBROBLASTS; CELLS; PDGF
AB Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets several tyrosine kinases, including PDGF receptor (PDGFR), was recently approved as an anti-fibrotic agent to reduce the deterioration of FVC in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the effects of PDGFR-alpha or -beta on pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. In an attempt to clarify their effects, we herein used blocking antibodies specific for PDGFR-alpha (APA5) and -beta (APB5) in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. The effects of these treatments on the growth of lung fibroblasts were examined using the H-3-thymidine incorporation assay in vitro. The anti-fibrotic effects of these antibodies were investigated with the Ashcroft score and collagen content of lungs treated with BLM. Their effects on inflammatory cells in the lungs were also analyzed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We investigated damage to epithelial cells and the proliferation of fibroblasts in the lungs. APA5 and APB5 inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGFR-alpha and -beta as well as the proliferation of lung fibroblasts induced by PDGF-AA and BB. The administration of APB5, but not APA5 effectively inhibited BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Apoptosis and the proliferation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts were significantly decreased by the treatment with APB5, but not by APA5. The late treatment with APB5 also ameliorated fibrosis in lungs treated with BLM. These results suggest that PDGFR-alpha and -beta exert different effects on BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. A specific approach using the blocking antibody for PDGFR-beta may be useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

TI I belong but I'm still sad: Reminders of Facebook increase feelings of
   belonging but do not facilitate coping with sadness
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIVIDUALISM; INTERPLAY; DISTRESS; CULTURE
AB One way in which people may cope with sadness is to seek positive social contact. We examined whether subtle reminders of Facebook increase positive mood and thus attenuate the interest in social activities that is typically enhanced by sad mood induction. Participants watched either a loss-related sad or neutral video and were afterwards presented with either a Facebook, positive (sun) or neutral (Word) icon. We then examined their mood and their desire to engage in social activities as well as their feeling of belonging. The presentation of the Facebook icon increased feelings of belonging, but it did not influence participants' other responses to the sad video. Participants reported more negative mood and a greater desire to engage in social activities after the sad (vs. control) video regardless of the icon condition. The results suggest that the activation of thoughts about Facebook can enhance users' feeling of belonging; however, this effect might not be sufficient to facilitate coping with loss-related sadness.

   reveals conserved redox activity

ID HIGH-EFFICIENCY TRANSFECTION; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; THIOREDOXIN SYSTEM;
   TARGET PROTEINS; MALARIA; BERGHEI; GENE; EXPRESSION; REDUCTION; COMPLEX
AB We recently identified three novel thioredoxin-like genes in the genome of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium that belong to the Phosducin-like family of proteins (PhLP). PhLPs are small cytosolic proteins hypothesized to function in G-protein signaling and protein folding. Although PhLPs are highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, only a few representatives have been experimentally characterized to date. In addition, while PhLPs contain a thioredoxin domain, they lack a CXXC motif, a strong indicator for redox activity, and it is unclear whether members of the PhLP family are enzymatically active. Here, we describe PbPhLP-3 as the first phosducin-like protein of a protozoan organism, Plasmodium berghei. Initial transcription analysis revealed continuous low-level expression of pbphlp-3 throughout the complex Plasmodium life cycle. Attempts to knockout pbphlp-3 in P. berghei did not yield live parasites, suggesting an essential role for the gene in Plasmodium. We cloned, expressed and purified PbPhLP-3 and determined that the recombinant protein is redox active in vitro in a thioredoxin-coupled redox assay. It also has the capacity to reduce the organic compound tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in vitro, albeit at low efficiency. Sequence analysis, structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a conserved cysteine in the thioredoxin domain to be the redox active residue. Lastly, we provide evidence that recombinant human PhLP-3 exhibits redox activity similar to that of PbPhLP-3 and suggest that redox activity may be conserved in PhLP-3 homologs of other species. Our data provide new insight into the function of PhLP-3, which is hypothesized to act as co-chaperones in the folding and regulation of cytoskeletal proteins. We discuss the potential implications of PhLP-3 as a thioredoxin-target protein and possible links between the cellular redox network and the eukaryotic protein folding machinery.

AB Introduction
   Living donor kidney transplantation is preferable to deceased donor transplantation due to its superior long-term patient and graft survivals. However, ABO blood group incompatibility is a major barrier to living donor kidney transplantation. ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation has been performed in Japan since the late 1980's, but it is still globally uncommon. The objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation (ABO-IKT) with that of ABO-compatible kidney transplantation (ABO-CKT) at an institution where only about two kidney transplants are performed a month on average.
   Design
   A single center propensity score-matched cohort study.
   Patients and methods
   We retrospectively collected and analyzed the data of 240 patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who underwent living donor kidney transplantation at Osaka City University Hospital from January 1999 to December 2016, of which 66 patients were ABO-IKT. The remaining 174 patients who underwent ABO-CKT were studied as the control group, and the clinical outcomes of ABO-IKT and ABO-CKT recipients were compared based on propensity score matching.
   Results
   After propensity score matching, there were no significant differences in both patient survival and death-censored graft survival rates between the ABO-IKT and ABO-CKT groups. Moreover, there were no significant differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate as well as frequency of acute cellular rejection, antibody-mediated rejection, infectious adverse events, malignancies, and post-operative bleeding between the two groups.
   Conclusion
   Currently, ABO-IKT may be an acceptable treatment for patients with ESKD even at a low-volume transplant center.

TI Early afterdepolarizations in cardiac action potentials as mixed mode
   oscillations due to a folded node singularity
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MYOCYTES; BIFURCATION; DYNAMICS; CANARDS
AB Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological voltage oscillations during the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials. They are considered as potential precursors to cardiac arrhythmias and have recently gained much attention in the context of preclinical drug safety testing under the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) paradigm. From the viewpoint of multiple time scales theory, the onset of EADs has previously been studied by means of mathematical action potential models with one slow ion channel gating variable. In this article, we for the first time associate EADs with mixed mode oscillations in dynamical systems with two slow gating variables and present a folded node singularity of the slow flow as a novel mechanism for EADs genesis. We derive regions of the pharmacology parameter space in which EADs occur using both the folded node analysis and a full system bifurcation analysis, and we suggest the normal distance to the boundary of the EADs region as a mechanism-based risk metric to computationally estimate a drug's proarrhythmic liability.

AB Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), the second most cultivated millet species, is well adapted to diverse environments and remains an important cereal food and forage crop in arid and semiarid regions worldwide. A symbolic crop for indigenous Austronesian peoples, foxtail millet has been cultivated in Taiwan for more than 5,000 years, and landraces reflect diversifying selection for various food applications. A total of 124 accessions collected within Taiwan were assessed for Wx genotypes. Four identified Wx alleles, I, III, IV, and IX were caused by insertion of various transposable elements (TEs) and resulted in endosperm with non-waxy, low amylose content (AC), and waxy, respectively. A total of 16.9%, 4.0%, 49.2%, and 29.8% of accessions were classified as type I, III, IV, and IX, respectively; approximately half of the accessions belonged to the waxy type, indicating that glutinous grains were favored for making traditional food and wine. The TE insertion affected splicing efficiency rather than accuracy, leading to significantly reduced expression of wx in types III, IV, and IX, although their transcripts were the same as wild-type, type I. Consequently, the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) contents of the three mutated genotypes were relatively low, leading to waxy or low AC endosperm, and the Wx genotypes could explain 78% of variance in AC. The geographic distribution of Wx genotypes are associated with culinary preferences and migration routes of Taiwanese indigenous peoples-in particular, the genotype of landraces collected from Orchid Island was distinct from those from Taiwan Island. This information on the major gene regulating starch biosynthesis in foxtail millet endosperm can be applied to breeding programs for grain quality, and contributes to knowledge of Austronesian cultures.

TI Impacts of impaired face perception on social interactions and quality
   of life in age-related macular degeneration: A qualitative study and new
   community resources

   ADJUSTMENT; EXPERIENCE
AB Aims
   Previous studies and community information about everyday difficulties in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have focussed on domains such as reading and driving. Here, we provide the first in-depth examination of how impaired face perception impacts social interactions and quality of life in AMD. We also develop a Faces and Social Life in AMD brochure and information sheet, plus accompanying conversation starter, aimed at AMD patients and those who interact with them (family, friends, nursing home staff).
   Method
   Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 21 AMD patients covering the full range from mild vision loss to legally blind. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of patient experiences.
   Results
   Patients reported faces appeared blurred and/or distorted. They described recurrent failures to recognise others' identity, facial expressions and emotional states, plus failures of alternative non-face strategies (e.g., hairstyle, voice). They reported failures to follow social nuances (e.g., to pick up that someone was joking), and feelings of missing out ('I can't join in'). Concern about offending others (e.g., by unintentionally ignoring them) was common, as were concerns of appearing fraudulent ('Other people don't understand'). Many reported social disengagement. Many reported specifically face-perception-related reductions in social life, confidence, and quality of life. All effects were observed even with only mild vision loss. Patients endorsed the value of our Faces and Social Life in AMD Information Sheet, developed from the interview results, and supported future technological assistance (digital image enhancement).
   Conclusion
   Poor face perception in AMD is an important domain contributing to impaired social interactions and quality of life. This domain should be directly assessed in quantitative quality of life measures, and in resources designed to improve community understanding. The identity-related social difficulties mirror those in prosopagnosia, of cortical rather than retinal origin, implying findings may generalise to all low-vision disorders.

   RECURRENCE; PICTURE; HEALTH; FEAR; REPRESENTATIONS
AB Objectives
   To explore the existence and importance of mental images of cancer among people with head and neck cancers with a focus on the perceived origins and meaning of mental images, their development over time, and their relationship to illness beliefs.
   Methods
   A longitudinal qualitative study consisting of 44 in-depth semi-structured interviews with 25 consecutive, newly-diagnosed head and neck cancer patients. Participants were invited to draw their images during the interviews. Follow-up interviews occurred after treatment completion. Analysis drew upon the principles of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).
   Results
   Many participants had mental images of their cancer which appeared to both embody and influence their beliefs about their illness, and affect their emotional response. For those who held them, mental images appeared to constitute an important part of their cognitive representation (understanding) of their illness. For some, their images also had a powerful emotional impact, being either reassuring or frightening. Images often appeared to originate from early clinical encounters, and remained fairly stable throughout treatment. Images could be conceptualised as 'concrete' (the perceived reality) and/or 'similic' (figurative). Patients' images reflected the perceived meaning, properties or 'intent' of the cancer-that is beliefs concerning the disease's identity, consequences and prognosis (likelihood of cure or control).
   Conclusions
   People with head and neck cancer may develop a mental image of their disease, often generated early within clinical encounters, which can both reflect and influence their understanding of the cancer. Such images tend to be stable over time. We theorise that careful use of images in early consultations could avoid or minimise some distress, including fears of outcome or recurrence. Concrete or similic images and language could be employed later to change perceptions and reduce distress.

   MORPHOGENESIS; APOPTOSIS; TRACT; CELLS; MALFORMATIONS
AB Objective
   There is no consensus on the embryonic components or morphogenetic processes involved in mature ventricular outflow tract development. Our goal was to use in vivo labelling to investigate the prospective fate of the myocardium of each conal wall. The conal and atrioventricular cushion mesenchyme changes during transformation into mature structures and their role in apoptosis were also investigated.
   Methods
   Plastic labels were placed at the cephalic and caudal conal limits of chicken embryo hearts (stage 22HH) and traced up to stage 36HH. Histological analyses, scanning electron microscopy and apoptotic detection using Lysotracker-Red were performed. The conal longitudinal length and medial displacement were registered. Muscle myosin was identified by immunofluorescence.
   Results
   Labels positioned in the myocardium of each conal wall moved to the right ventricle (RV), shifting from the arterial subvalvular myocardial zone to the apex. No labels were found in the aortic vestibule. At stage 22HH, the conus was a tubular structure composed of myocardium and endocardium with scarce mesenchyme. The dorso-left conal myocardial wall gradually lost continuity and the free ends separated, while the myocardium was distributed to the RV free wall (24HH-28HH). At stage 22HH, conal crests were not observed, but they were apparent at the dorsal zone of the conus at stage 26HH; towards stage 30HH, they fused to form the supraventricular crest, and the pulmonary infundibulum was evident. The ventro-superior cushion of the AV canal was reorganized into the fibrous and muscular structures lined the aortic vestibule.
   Conclusions
   The posterior conus is an erroneous concept. The conal myocardium is reorganized in the free wall of the RV. Internally, the conal lumen is transformed into the pulmonary infundibulum. The aortic vestibule is formed from the ventro-superior cushion of the AV canal. Thus, the ventricular outflow tracts have different embryonic origins.

AB Promoting physical activities is important for medical and functional recovery after stroke. Therefore, an accurate and convenient measurement of physical activities is necessary to provide feedback on functional status and effects of rehabilitative interventions. We assessed the feasibility, reliability, and validity of wearing accelerometers to monitor physical activities of stroke patients by estimating energy expenditure. This was a prospective observational quantitative study conducted in an inpatient rehabilitation unit. Twenty-four patients with subacute stroke were enrolled. They wore accelerometers on wrists and ankles for three consecutive weekdays. The feasibility was evaluated by daily wear-time. The test-retest reliability was determined by intra-class correlation coefficient. The validity was evaluated by comparing accelerometeric data to behavior mappings using Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rho correlation coefficient (r) and Bland-Altman plots. Average wearing time for four accelerometers was 20.99 +/- 3.28 hours per day. The 3-day accelerometer recording showed excellent test-retest reliability. For sedentary activities, wrist accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than ankle accelerometers. For light to moderate activities, ankle accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than wrist accelerometers. Overall, combined models of accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than separate ones. Wearing accelerometers for 24 h may be useful for measuring physical activities in subjects with subacute stroke in an inpatient rehabilitation unit.

   BIOMARKERS; RESISTANCE; NIVOLUMAB; THERAPY
AB Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies have had major success in treating patients with late-stage cancers, yet the minority of patients benefit. Mutation load and PD-L1 staining are leading biomarkers associated with response, but each is an imperfect predictor. A key challenge to predicting response is modeling the interaction between the tumor and immune system. We begin to address this challenge with a multifactorial model for response to anti-PD-L1 therapy. We train a model to predict immune response in patients after treatment based on 36 clinical, tumor, and circulating features collected prior to treatment. We analyze data from 21 bladder cancer patients using the elastic net high-dimensional regression procedure and, as training set error is a biased and overly optimistic measure of prediction error, we use leave-one-out cross-validation to obtain unbiased estimates of accuracy on held-out patients. In held-out patients, the model explains 79% of the variance in T cell clonal expansion. This predicted immune response is multifactorial, as the variance explained is at most 23% if clinical, tumor, or circulating features are excluded. Moreover, if patients are triaged according to predicted expansion, only 38% of non-durable clinical benefit (DCB) patients need be treated to ensure that 100% of DCB patients are treated. In contrast, using mutation load or PD-L1 staining alone, one must treat at least 77% of non-DCB patients to ensure that all DCB patients receive treatment. Thus, integrative models of immune response may improve our ability to anticipate clinical benefit of immunotherapy.

TI Hair pyrrole adducts serve as biomarkers for peripheral nerve impairment
   induced by 2,5-hexanedione and n-hexane in rats
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CROSS-LINKING; NEUROFILAMENT; NEUROPATHY; EXPOSURE; BINDING; URINE
AB Pyrrole adducts are specific reaction products of 2,5-hexadione (2,5-HD) in vivo and are considered highly relevant to the pathogenesis of peripheral nerve impairments after exposure to n-hexane, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and one control group, in which all rat's hair were shaved completely at the beginning. The rats in three experimental groups were treated with 2,5-HD by gavage at dosages of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg per day respectively, six times per week for 8 weeks. Abnormality of gait and changes in the rota-rod latency were surveilled. Pyrrole adducts in hair, urine and serum of all rats were measured at the endpoint. Results showed that the increased pyrrole adducts in hair, urine and serum accumulated in dose-response relationship. Spearman's correlation analysis between pyrrole adducts and gait scores showed that hair pyrrole adducts were highly relevant to the gait scores. Moreover, we treated rats with n-hexane and succeed to verify the results aforesaid. Further, multiply linear regression analysis showed that hair pyrrole adducts have higher partial correlation coefficients than these in serum and urine in both 2,5-HD and n-hexane treated models. Our findings draw the conclusion that the hair pyrrole adducts might serve as a promising biomarker of n-hexane induced peripheral neuropathy.

TI Baseline Troponin T level in stroke and its association with stress
   cardiomyopathy
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ELEVATED TROPONIN; DETERMINANTS; LOCATION
AB Background
   Differential diagnosis of elevated high sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT) in acute ischemic stroke includes myocardial infarction (MI) and neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM). The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with baseline hsTnT levels and MI or NSM in acute ischemic stroke.
   Methods
   We studied 204 consecutive patients of the prospective acquired Bern Stroke Database with acute ischemic stroke diagnosed by brain MR. All patient histories and cardiac examinations were reviewed retrospectively. Volumetry of lesions on diffusion and perfusion weighted brain imaging (circular singular value decomposition, Tmax >6sec) was performed. Voxel based analysis was performed to identify brain areas associated with hsTnT elevation. Linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of baseline hsTnT levels and myocardial infarction.
   Results
   Elevated hsTnT was observed in 58 of the 204 patients (28.4%). The mean age was 68.3 years in the normal hsTnT group and 69.7 years in the elevated hsTnT group. Creatinine (p<0.001, OR 6.735, 95% CI 58.734-107.423), baseline NIHSS score (p = 0.029, OR 2.207, 95% CI 0.675-12.096), ST segment depression (p = 0.025, OR 2.259, 95% CI 2.419-35.838), and negative T waves in baseline ECG (p = 0.002, OR 3.209, 95% CI 13.007-54.564) were associated with hsTnT elevation, while infarct location and size were not. Coronary angiography was performed in 30 of the 204 patients (14.7%) and myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 7 of them (23.3%). Predictive factors for myocardial infarction could not be identified.
   Conclusion
   Elevated baseline baseline hsTnT was associated with NIHSS, creatinine, ST segment depression and inverted T waves, but not with stroke location or size. None of the factors was helpful to differentiate MI and NSM. Therefore, ancillary investigations such as coronary angiography, cardiac MRI or both may be needed to solve the differential diagnosis.

TI Angiolytic laser stripping versus CO2 laser microflap excision for vocal
   fold leukoplakia: Long-term disease control and voice outcomes
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PULSED DYE-LASER; LARYNGEAL DYSPLASIA; MANAGEMENT
AB Background and purpose
   Vocal fold leukoplakia, white plaque on the epithelium, has the potential for malignant transformation regardless of dysplasia grade. It is treated with different laser types (CO2 or angiolytic) and various techniques (vaporization, stripping, or excision); however, only a few studies exist regarding comparative laser surgery results. This study was conducted to investigate clinical outcomes of CO2 versus angiolytic laser microdissection with regard to long-term disease control and voice preservation in vocal fold leukoplakia.
   Materials and methods
   Seventy patients with vocal fold leukoplakia treated by CO2 or angiolytic laser (pulsed dye laser or potassium titanyl phosphate) were identified retrospectively. Data regarding patient characteristics, treatment details, treatment outcomes including disease control (recurrence and progression) and the Voice Handicap Index, GRBAS scale, and acoustics were evaluated. The mean follow-up duration after initial treatment was 32 +/- 26 months.
   Results
   The study group comprised 14 patients who underwent CO2 laser microflap excision and 56 who underwent angiolytic laser stripping. Of the patients treated with CO2 laser, 11 (79%) had no recurrence and three (21%) showed recurrent leukoplakia, of which one patient (7%) showed histologic grade progression. Of patients who underwent angiolytic laser stripping, 12 had disease recurrence (21%), among whom three (5%) showed disease progression. Laser surgery type, disease extent, and histologic grade showed no significant differences in recurrence or progression rates. The postoperative Voice Handicap Index significantly improved (P = .03) and the G score significantly decreased (P < .001) in the angiolytic laser treatment group. In contrast, the Voice Handicap Index increased postoperatively in the CO2 laser group (P = .046).
   Conclusions
   The long-term recurrence or progression rates were not significantly different between angiolytic and CO2 laser treatment. The angiolytic laser stripping group showed better voice preservation compared with the CO2 laser group. Angiolytic laser stripping is suggested as an effective treatment option for vocal fold leukoplakia with comparable disease control and better voice preservation.

AB Background
   The role of surgery in treating small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains controversial. This meta-analysis aims to determine whether surgical-based treatment improves survival in comparison to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy for stage I to III SCLC.
   Methods
   PubMed, PubMed Central, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles. The main outcome were overall survival (OS), reported as hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results
   Two randomized control trials (RCTs) and 13 retrospective studies that included a total of 41,483 patients were eligible. Surgical resection significantly improved OS when compared to non-surgical treatment in retrospective studies (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.49-0.64, P < 0.001), but not in the 2 "older" RCTs (HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.32-1.84, P = 0.55). In the subgroup analysis for retrospective studies, surgical resection was associated with superior OS in stage I (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.49-0.64, P < 0.001), stage II (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.570.99, P = 0.04), and stage III diseases (HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.88, P = 0.002). Sublobar resection resulted in worse OS than a lobectomy (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.56-0.74, P < 0.001) for patients undergoing surgical resection.
   Conclusions
   Surgery-based multi-modality treatment appears to be associated with a favorable survival advantage in stage I and selected stage II to III SCLC. Lobectomy is likely to provide superior OS when compared to sublobar resection. Further prospective RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.

TI Characteristics of maternity waiting homes and the women who use them:
   Findings from a baseline cross-sectional household survey among
   SMGL-supported districts in Zambia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Objective
   Maternity waiting homes (MWHs) have been identified as one solution to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality by bringing women living in hard-to-reach areas closer to a hospital or health center that provides emergency obstetric care. The objective of this study was to obtain data on current MWH characteristics and the women who use them as well as women's perceptions and experiences with MWHs among seven Saving Mothers Giving Life (SMGL) supported districts in Zambia.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional household survey design was used to collect data from 2381 mothers who delivered a child in the past 13 months from catchment areas associated with 40 health care facilities in seven districts. Multi-stage random sampling procedures were employed with probability proportionate to population size randomly selected. Logistic regression models, Chi-square, and independent t-tests were used to analyze the data.
   Results
   Women who lived 15-24 km from a health care facility were more likely to use a MWH when compared to women who lived 9.5-9.9 km from the nearest facility (AOR: 1.722, 95% CI: 1.450, 2.045) as were women who lived 25 km or more (AOR: 2.098, 95% CI: 1.176, 3.722.881). Women who were not married had lower odds of utilizing a MWH when compared to married women (AOR: 0.590, 95% CI: 0.369, 0.941). Over half of mothers using a MWH prior to delivery reported problems at the MWH related to boredom (42.4%), management oversight (33.3%), safety (33.4%), and quality (43.7%). While the study employs a robust design, it is limited by its focus in Saving Mothers Giving Life districts.
   Conclusion
   MWHs, which currently take many forms in Zambia, are being used by over a third of women delivering at a health facility in our study. Although over half of women using the existing MWHs noted crowdedness and nearly a third reported problems with the physical quality of the building as well as with their interaction with staff, these MWHs appear to be bridging the distance barrier for women who live greater than 9.5 km from a health care facility.

TI Conditional cash transfer programme: Impact on homicide rates and
   hospitalisations from violence in Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CRIME; HEALTH; MORTALITY
AB Background
   Homicide kills more people than war globally and is associated with income inequality. In Brazil, one of the most unequal countries of the world, the homicide rate is four times higher than the world average. Establishing if the Brazilian conditional cash transfer programme [Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP)], the largest in the world, is associated with a reduction in the rate of homicide is relevant for violence prevention programs. We aimed to assess the effect of BFP coverage on homicide and hospitalization rates from violence.
   Methods
   BFP coverage and rates of homicide (overall and disaggregated by sex and age) and hospitalizations from violence from all 5,507 Brazilian municipalities between 2004 and 2012 were explored using multivariable negative binomial regression models with fixed effect for panel data. Robustness of results was explored using sensitivity analyses such as difference-in-difference models.
   Findings
   Homicide rates and hospitalization from violence decreased as BFP coverage in the target population increased. For each percent increase in the uptake of the BFP, the homicide rate decreased by 0.3% (Rate Ratio: 0.997;95%CI: 0.996-0.997) and hospitalizations from violence by 0.4% (RR: 0.996;95%CI: 0.995-0.996). Rates of homicide and hospitalizations from violence were also negatively associated with the duration of BFP coverage. When, coverage of the target population was at least 70% for one-year, hospitalizations from violence decreased by 8%; two-years 14%, three-years 20%, and four years 25%.
   Interpretation
   Our results support the hypothesis that conditional cash transfer programs might have as an additional benefit the prevention of homicides and hospitalizations from violence. Social protection interventions could contribute to decrease levels of violence in low-and-middleincome-countries through reducing poverty and/or socioeconomic inequalities.

TI Prevalence of protective tetanus antibodies and immunological response
   following tetanus toxoid vaccination among men seeking medical
   circumcision services in Uganda
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HIV PREVENTION; DIPHTHERIA; CHILDREN; RAKAI
AB Introduction
   Tetanus infection associated with men who had male circumcision has been reported in East Africa, suggesting a need for tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV).
   Objective
   To determine the prevalence of tetanus toxoid antibodies following vaccination among men seeking circumcision.
   Methods
   We enrolled 620 consenting men who completed a questionnaire and received TTCV at enrollment (day 0) prior to circumcision on day 28. Blood samples were obtained at day 0 from all enrollees and on days 14, 28 and 42 from a random sample of 237 participants. Tetanus toxoid (TT) IgG antibody levels were assayed using EUROIMMUN. Analyses included prevalence of TT antibodies at enrollment and used a mixed effects model to determine the immunological response.
   Results
   Mean age was 21.4 years, 65.2% had knowledge of tetanus, 56.6% knew how tetanus was contracted, 22.8% reported ever receipt of TTCV, and 16.8% had current/recently healed wounds. Insufficient tetanus immunity was 57.1% at enrollment, 7.2% at day 14, 3.8% at day 28, and 0% at day 42. Antibody concentration was 0.44IU/ml (CI 0.35-0.53) on day 0, 3.86IU/ml (CI 3.60-4.11) on day 14, 4.05IU/ml (CI 3.81-4.29) on day 28, and 4.48IU/ml (CI 4.28-4.68) on day 42. TT antibodies increased by 0.24IU/ml (CI 0.23, 0.26) between days 0 and 14 and by 0.023IU/ml (CI 0.015, 0.031) between days 14 and 42 days. Immunological response was poorer in HIV-infected clients and men aged 35+ years.
   Conclusion
   Insufficient immunity was common prior to TTCV, and a protective immunological response was achieved by day 14. Circumcision may safely be provided 14 days after vaccination in HIV-uninfected men aged less than 35 years.

AB Physicians' motivation plays avital role in health systems particularly in dense and urban cities, which deal with high volumes of patients in a variety of settings. The loss of physicians due to low motivation to developed countries is also a critical aspect affecting the quality of care in many regions. Fewer studies have explored health provider and particularly physicians' motivation in developing countries, which is critical to health service delivery. In addition, limited relevant tools have been developed and tested in low and middle-income settings like Pakistan. The purpose of this study was to create and test a tool for measuring physician motivation. A tool was developed to explore physicians' motivation in the Lahore district, Pakistan. Three sections of the questionnaire, which included intrinsic, socio-cultural and organizational factors, were tested with a stratified, random sample of 360 physicians from the public and private health facilities. Factor analysis produced six factors for 'intrinsic motivation,' seven for 'organizational motivation' and three for 'socio-cultural motivation' that explained 47.7%, 52.6% and 40.6% of the total variance, respectively. Bartlett's test of sphericity and the KMO were significant. Cronbach's a and confirmatory factor analysis were found satisfactory for all three sections of questionnaires. In addition to identifying important intrinsic, socio-cultural and organizational factors study found the questionnaires reliable and valid and recommend further testing the applicability of the instrument in similar and diverse settings.

TI qPCR detection of Sturgeon chub (Macrhybopsis gelida) DNA in
   environmental samples
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MISSOURI RIVER; MEEKI
AB The Sturgeon chub (Macrhybopsis gelida) is a cyprinid fish native to the Missouri and Mississippi River basins of the U.S. Suspected long-term declines in the size of its distribution have prompted a review of its conservation status by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a process which depends on reliable methods to delineate the distribution and status of extant populations. To facilitate monitoring of Sturgeon chub populations, we developed a quantitative PCR assay to detect Sturgeon chub DNA in environmental samples. The assay consistently detected Sturgeon chub DNA in concentrations as low as 2 copies per reaction, and did not amplify DNA from non-target fish species that are sympatric in the upper Missouri River basin. Field tests of this assay with environmental samples successfully detected Sturgeon chub from sites known to be occupied. This assay offers an extremely sensitive methodology that can be applied to determine the range of Sturgeon chub, regardless of variation in habitat characteristics.

TI The Mediterranean as a melting pot: Phylogeography of Loxosceles
   rufescens (Sicariidae) in the Mediterranean Basin
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ARANEAE SICARIIDAE; RECLUSE SPIDER; PROGRAM
AB The species Loxosceles rufescens is native to the Mediterranean but considered cosmopolitan because it has been dispersed worldwide. A previous study revealed 11 evolutionary lineages across the Mediterranean, grouped into two main clades, without any clear phylogeographic pattern. The high genetic diversity within this species (p-distances of up to 7.8% in some Mediterranean lineages), together with the results obtained with different species delimitation methods (GMYC, TCS) could indicate the existence of cryptic species. Here we compare the mitochondrial and microsatellite diversity to elucidate if the lineages of L. rufescens in the Mediterranean should be considered different species (cryptic species) or populations of the same species. To do so, we analyzed the cox1 diversity of 196 individuals, of which, we genotyped 148, sampled from 19 localities across the Mediterranean. STRUCTURE analyses of microsatellite data identified two genetic clusters of L. rufescens. One cluster included individuals from Western Mediterranean localities (Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, Balearic Islands) and Israel, while the second one grouped individuals from Italian and Greek localities, including Sardinia, Sicily and Tunisia. These patterns suggest that geographic proximity is the more significant factor in the clustering with microsatellite data and shows the existence of gene flow between the nearest geographic areas, even if the individuals belong to different mitochondrial lineages or clades. The lack of correspondence between both genetic markers suggests that the evolutionary lineages found within L. rufescens should not be considered different species. We conclude that these phylogenetic linages and their distribution may be the result of the maternal evolutionary history of the species and human-mediated dispersion.

   with low human epidermal growth factor-like receptor 2 expression

   PACLITAXEL; CD137; OVEREXPRESSION
AB Because human epidermal growth factor-like receptor (HER) 2 is expressed on the surface of human pancreatic carcinoma cells to varying degrees, trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), is expected to exert antibody-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the cells. However, some reports found that the effect of trastuzumab against human pancreatic carcinoma cells was limited because most express only limited HER2. We examined whether anti-CD137 stimulating mAb could enhance trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1, a human pancreatic cancer cell line with low HER2 expression, in vitro. Supplementation of anti-CD137 mAb could improve trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 which was insufficient without this stimulating antibody. The ADCC differed in individual cells, and this was related to the expression of CD137 on the surface of NK cells after trastuzumab stimulation in association with the Fc gamma-RIIIA polymorphism. NK cells with Fc gamma-RIIIA-VV/VF showed high levels of ADCC against Panc-1, but those with Fc gamma-RIIIA-FF did not show optimal ADCC. In addition, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against the human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 with high HER2 expression was generally high and not affected by the Fc gamma-RIIIA polymorphism. These results demonstrated that in Fc gamma-RIIIA-VV/VF-carrying healthy individuals, trastuzumab plus aCD137 mAb could induce effective ADCC against HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines, and that such an approach may result in similar findings in patients with pancreatic cancer.

AB The marine bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae (Pdd) is a generalist and facultative pathogen that causes disease in a wide range of marine animals including fish species of importance in aquaculture. Disease outbreaks in fish farms have been correlated with an increased water temperature during summer months. In this study, we have used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of Pdd RM-71 cultured at two different temperatures, which simulated temperature conditions experienced during free swimming lifestyle at mid latitudes in winter months (15 degrees C) and during outbreaks in aquaculture in warm summer months (25 degrees C). The enhanced bacterial growth of Pdd observed at 25 degrees C in comparison to 15 degrees C suggests that an elevated seawater temperature contributes to the build-up of a sufficient bacterial population to cause disease. In comparison to growth at 15 degrees C, growth at 25 degrees C resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in DNA synthesis, nutrient uptake, chemotaxis, flagellar motility, secretion systems and antimicrobial resistance. Plasmid-encoded virulence factors, which include a putative adhesin/invasin OmpU, a transferrin receptor and a serum resistance protein, were also upregulated. Transcription factor RpoS, genes involved in cold shock response, modulation of cell envelope and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes of yet unknown function were downregulated at 25 degrees C. Notably, the gene encoding damselysin cytotoxin (Dly) was among the most highly transcribed genes at the two assayed temperatures, at levels comparable to the most highly expressed housekeeping genes. This study contributes to our understanding of the regulatory networks and biology of a generalist marine bacterial pathogen, and provides evidence that temperature regulates multiple physiological and virulence-related functions in Pdd.

AB Introduction
   Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with rate and severity of trauma. However, it is unclear whether there is an independent association between SES and mortality after injury. Our aim was to assess the relationship between SES and mortality from trauma.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted a secondary analysis of the Trauma Audit and Research Network dataset. Participants were patients admitted to NHS hospitals for trauma between January 2015 and December 2015, and resident in England. Analyses used multivariate logistic regression with thirty-day mortality as the main outcome. Co-variates include SES derived from area-level deprivation, age, injury severity and comorbidity. All analyses were stratified into minor and major trauma.
   Results
   There were 48,652 admissions (68% for minor injury, ISS<15) included, and 3,792 deaths. Thirty-day mortality was 10% for patients over 85 with minor trauma, which was higher than major trauma for all age groups under 65. Deprivation was not significantly associated with major trauma mortality. For minor trauma, patients older than 40 had significantly higher aORs than the 0-15 age group. Both the most and second most deprived had significantly higher aORs (1.35 and 1.28 respectively).
   Conclusions
   This study provides evidence of an independent relationship between SES and mortality after minor trauma, but not for major trauma. Our results identify that, for less severe trauma, older patients and patients with low SES with have an increased risk of 30-day mortality. Policy makers and service providers should consider extending the provision of 'major trauma' healthcare delivery to this at-risk population.

AB Zoonotic diseases continue to affect the health and livelihood of resource limited communities. In Ethiopia, despite the presence of a national master plan for prevention, control and elimination of some common zoonotic diseases, well-organized epidemiological data regarding incidence and distribution are lacking. A retrospective cross-sectional study based on a patient medical data recorded from 2012-2016 in selected districts of Southern Tigray, North Wollo zone of Amhara region and Ab'Ala district of Afar region was conducted to map the distribution and Incidence proportion of major zoonotic diseases. The incidence proportion of four major zoonotic diseases (helminthiasis, tuberculosis (TB), rabies and schistosomiasis) was mapped using qGIS software based on the Health Management Information System (HMIS) data collected from district health facilities. The result indicated that, out of a total 1,273,145 observed human disease cases, 53,614 (4.2%) of them were potential zoonotic diseases that include: helminthiasis (51,192), TB (2,085), rabies (227), schistosomiasis (105) and visceral leishmaniasis (7). The highest incidence proportion of TB (262.8 cases per 100,000 population) and rabies (33.2 cases per 100,000 population) were recorded in Gubalafto and Weldya followed by Raya Alamata (253.4 cases per 100,000 population %), and Ab'Ala and Raya Azebo (29 cases each per 100,000 population) for TB and rabies, respectively. The highest incidence proportion for schistosomiasis was reported in Raya Alamata (50.1 cases per 100,000 population) followed by Gubalafto and Weldya (10.8 cases per 100,000 population). The incidence proportion of visceral leishmaniasis per 100,000 population was 4.1, 1.3 and 1.2 cases for Ab'Ala, Gubalafto and Weldiya, and Raya Azebo districts, respectively. Except rabies, which showed high incidence proportion (p<0.0001) in 5-14 age groups, the other zoonotic diseases showed higher incidence proportion (p<0.0001) in age groups above 15 years. Rabies, helminthiasis and schistosomiasis showed statistically significant variation (p<0.0001) among seasons. Rabies and TB showed decreasing trend within the data recorded years. In animals, only 31 rabies cases and 15 anthrax cases were recorded from 2012 to 2016. This finding highlighted the distribution and incidence of some major zoonotic diseases in the study areas. Systematic and detailed research should be conducted in the future to map the distribution of major zoonotic diseases at regional and country level so as to initiate integrated effort from human and animal health authorities and professionals.

AB The effects of the macrostructure of long chain fatty acids on the lipid metabolism and biosynthesis of lipid droplets (LD) was studied in mammary epithelial cells (MEC). MEC were exposed to similar compositions and concentrations of fatty acids in the form of either triglycerides (Tg), as part of the very-low-density lipids (VLDL) isolated from lactating cow plasma, or as non-esterified-free fatty acids (FFA). Exposing MEC to FFA resulted in two distinct processes; each independently could increase LD size: an elevation in Tg production and alterations in phospholipid (PL) composition. In particular, the lower PC/PE ratio in the FFA treatment indicated membrane destabilization, which was concomitant with the biosynthesis of larger LD. In addition, 6 fold increase in the cellular concentration of the exogenously added linoleic acid (C18:2) was found in MEC treated with FFA, implying that long chain fatty acids administrated as FFA have higher availability to MEC, enabling greater PL synthesis, more material for the LD envelope, thereby enhancing LD formation. Availability of long chain fatty acids administrated as VLDL-Tg, is dependent on LPL which its activity can be inhibited by the hydrolysis products. Therefore, we used increasing concentrations of albumin, to reduce the allosteric inhibition on LPL by the hydrolysis products. Indeed, a combined treatment of VLDL and albumin, increased LD size and number, similar to the phenotype found in the FFA treatment. These results reveal the role played by the macrostructure of long chain fatty acids in the regulation of LD size in MEC which determine the size of the secreted MFG.

TI Facing the urban-rural gap in patients with chronic kidney disease:
   Evidence from inpatients with urban or rural medical insurance in
   central China
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID CATASTROPHIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE; PREVALENCE; ADULTS; NUTRITION;
   AWARENESS; MORTALITY
AB Background
   In view of the irreversible pathology of progressive exacerbation, the societal burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing along with the rise in total health expenditure. Meanwhile, disparities remain among urban and rural citizens with different types of health insurance. This study aimed to assess the socioeconomic disparities between hospitalized CKD patients in urban and rural areas.
   Method
   A total of 501 CKD inpatients with urban or rural medical insurance (UMI or RMI, respectively) were selected from the top six tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected as influencing factors. Data evaluation was performed using univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Result
   Socioeconomic characteristics showed differences among hospitalized CKD patients with different health insurances. Patients with RMI were younger, and reported lower education levels, poor domestic economic conditions, shorter duration, and less frequent hospital stays than those with UMI (P<0.05). The predictors revealed varying associations between UMI and RMI. Among the hospitalized CKD patients with UMI, male and low-education individuals presented high hospitalization expenses (beta(gender) = -0.406, beta(education) (level) = 0.357, P<0.05). By contrast, no significant difference in this aspect was found among RMI inpatients.
   Conclusions
   Care delivery and reimbursement models should be re-designed and implemented to improve equity among different CKD patients. The national health education should also be enhanced to prevent CKD and provide early treatment.

AB Although the study of pathogen sensing by host defense systems continues to uncover a role for inflammasome components specific to particular pathogens, gaps remain in our knowledge. After internalization, Francisella escapes from the phagosome in mononuclear cells and is thought to be detected by intracellular pathogen-response-receptors pyrin and Aim2 in human and murine models, respectively. However, it remains controversial as to the role of pyrin in detecting Francisella. Our current work aims to study the contribution of inflammasome sensor, Pyrin in regulating microparticulate caspase-1/GSDM-D activation by Francisella. Our findings suggest that NLRP3 is central to the activation/release of active caspase-1/GSDM-D encapsulated in microparticles (MP) by Francisella. We also provide evidence that this regulation is independent of pyrin, implicated in sensing cytosolic Francisella in NLRP3-/- conditions where endogenous Pyrin is present. Absence of NLRP3 completely abrogated Francisella mediated MP caspase-1/GSDM-D activation and release both before and after internalization of the pathogen. However, deletion of pyrin not only enhanced both LPS and Francisella mediated MP active caspase-1/GSDM-D release, but pyrin overexpression resulted in a reduction of inflammasome activation and release; suggesting an inhibitory role of pyrin in LPS and Francisella mediated MP responses. This NLRP3 dependence and inhibitory effect of pyrin correlated with cytokine release as well. These observations also correlated with MPs ability to induce cell death; as LPS and Francisella-induced MPs from pyrin-deficient cells were more potent than wild-type monocytes whereas, NLRP3-/- MPs failed to induce cell death. Taken together, we report that NLPR3 not only mediates Francisella induced cytokine responses, but is also critical for cytokine-independent microparticle-induced inflammasome activation and endothelial cell injury independent of pyrin.

AB Advances in oncology have enabled physicians to treat low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN) in outpatient settings. This study was aimed to explore the usefulness of the CISNE model and identify better triage in the emergency setting. This is a retrospective cohort study on 400 adult FN patients presenting to the Emergency Department of National Cancer Center, Korea from January 2010 to December 2016. All had been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for solid tumors in the previous 30 days. The primary outcome was the frequency of any serious complications during the duration of illness. Apparently stable patients numbered 299 (74.8%) of 400, and the remainder comprised clinically unstable patients. The stable patients fell into three cohorts according to the risk scores: CISNE I (low risk), 56 patients (18.7%); CISNE II (intermediate), 124 (41.5%) and CISNE III (high), 119 (39.8%). The primary outcome occurred in 10.7%, 19.4% and 33.6%, respectively, according to the cohort. Compared with the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer Risk Index Score (MASCC RIS), CISNE I stratum had significantly lower sensitivity (0.22 vs. 0.95 of MASCC low risk) but higher specificity (0.91 vs. 0.17) to predict zero occurrence of the primary outcome. The CISNE model was useful for identifying low-risk FN patients for outpatient treatment. The combination of the CISNE and MASCC RIS may help emergency physicians cope with FN more confidently.

TI Potential corner case cautions regarding publicly available
   implementations of the National Cancer Institute's nonwear/wear
   classification algorithm for accelerometer data
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; UNITED-STATES; CALIBRATION; TIME; IDENTIFICATION;
   VALIDATION
AB The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) wear time classification algorithm uses a rule based on the occurrence of physical activity data counts-a cumulative measure of movement, influenced by both magnitude and duration of acceleration-to differentiate between when a physical activity monitoring (PAM) device (ActiGraph accelerometer) is being worn by a participant (wear) from when it is not (nonwear). It was applied to PAM data generated from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2004). We discuss two corner case conditions that can produce unexpected, and perhaps unintended results when the algorithm is applied. We show, using simulated data of two special cases, how this algorithm classifies a 24-hour period with only 72 total counts as 100% wear in one case, and classifies a 24-hour period with 96,000 counts as 0.1% wear in another. The prevalence of like scenarios in the NHANES 2003-2004 PAM dataset is presented with corresponding summary statistics for varying degrees of the algorithm's nonwear classification threshold (T). The number of participants with valid days, defined as 10 or more hours classified as wear time in a 24-hour day, increased while the mean counts-per-minute (CPM) decreased as the threshold for excluding non-wear was reduced from the allowed 4,000 counts in an hour. The number of participants with four or more valid days increased 2.29% (n = 113) and mean CPM dropped 2.45% (9.5 CPM) when adjusting the nonwear classification threshold to 50 counts an hour. Applying the most liberal criteria, only excluding hours as nonwear which contained 1 count or less, resulted in a 397 more participants (7.83% increase) and 26.5 fewer CPM (6.98% decrease) in NHANES 2003-2004 participants with four or more valid days. The algorithm should be used with caution due to the potential influence of these corner cases.

AB In this work, we analyse and model a real life financial loan application belonging to a sample bank in the Netherlands. The event log is robust in terms of data, containing a total of 262 200 event logs, belonging to 13 087 different credit applications. The goal is to work out a decision model, which represents the underlying tasks that make up the loan application service. To this end we study the impact of incomplete event logs (for instance workers forget to register their tasks). The absence of data is translated into a drastic decrease of precision and compromises the decision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. We use non-classical probability to show we can better reduce the error percentage of inferences as opposed to classical probability.

TI Neck muscle responses of driver and front seat passenger during
   frontal-oblique collisions
SO PLOS ONE

   RISK
AB Background
   Low-velocity motor vehicle crashes often lead to severe and chronic neck disorders also referred to as whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). The etiology of WAD is still not fully understood. Many studies using a real or simulated collision scenario have focused on rear-end collisions, whereas the kinematics and muscular responses during frontal-oblique collisions have hardly been investigated. In particular for rear-end collisions, drivers were shown to have a higher WAD risk than front seat passengers. Yet, independently from the impact direction, neither the muscular nor the kinematic responses of drivers and front seat passengers have been compared to date, although some findings indicate that the neck muscles have the potential to alter the head and neck kinematics, and that the level of neck muscle activity during impact may be relevant for the emergence of WAD.
   Objective
   In this study, we quantitatively examined the subjects' neck muscle activity during low-velocity left-frontal-oblique impacts to gain further insights into the neuromuscular mechanism underlying whiplash-like perturbations that may lead to WAD.
   Methods
   In a within-subject study design, we varied several impact parameters to investigate their effect on neck muscle response amplitude and delay. Fifty-two subjects experienced at least ten collisions while controlling for the following parameters: change in velocity Delta v (3 / 6 km/h), seating position (driver /front seat passenger), and deliberate pre-tension of the musculature (tense /relaxed) to account for a potential difference between an expected and an unexpected crash. Ten of the 52 subjects additionally ran the same experimental conditions as above, but without wearing a safety belt.
   Findings
   There were significant main effects of Delta v and muscle pre-tension on the reflex amplitude but not of seating position. As for the reflex delay, there was a significant main effect of muscle pre-tension, but neither of Delta v nor of seating position. Moreover, neither the safety belt nor its asymmetrical orientation had an influence on the reflexive responses of the occupants.
   Conclusion
   In summary, we did not find any significant differences in the reflex amplitude and delay of the neck musculature between drivers and front seat passengers. We therefore concluded that an increased risk of the driver sustaining WAD in frontal-oblique collisions, if it exists, cannot be due to differences in the reflexive responses.

TI Progress toward implementing the Swiss Hepatitis Strategy: Is HCV
   elimination possible by 2030?
SO PLOS ONE

ID C VIRUS-INFECTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE
AB Catalyzed by the concerns over the growing public health and economic burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Switzerland, a diverse group of experts and patient representatives came together in 2014 to develop the Swiss Hepatitis Strategy, setting targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis in Switzerland by 2030. Previous studies have reported the estimated number of chronic HCV infections and forecasted burden of disease given different intervention strategies. However, given new prevalence data by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, which decreased total infections by about half, an updated analysis is warranted. We aimed to provide an updated viremic prevalence estimate for Switzerland and evaluate the impact on forecasted liver related morbidity and mortality of an 'inaction' scenario and intervention scenarios to achieve the Global Health Sector Strategy for Viral Hepatitis and Swiss Hepatitis Strategy goals by 2030. A Markov disease-progression model was used to calculate the present and future burden of HCV infection by disease stage according to these different strategies. In 2017, there were an estimated 36,800 (95% UI: 26,90039,200) viremic infections in Switzerland. Given the current standard of care, total viremic infections are expected to decline by 45%, while cases of decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths will decrease by 20%. If treatment and diagnosis efforts were to cease in 2018, late stage HCV-related morbidity and mortality would increase by 90-100% by 2030. Increasing treatment and diagnosis to achieve the Global Health Sector Strategy or Swiss Hepatitis Strategy goals by 2030, will reduce the number of chronic infections to less than 13,000 and 4,000, respectively. Although the HCV epidemic is declining in Switzerland, efforts to expand diagnosis and treatment are needed to achieve elimination by 2030.

AB Tolerance to bitter foods and its potentiation by repetitive exposure are commonly experienced and potentially underlie the consumption of bitter foods, but it remains unknown whether permissive and adaptive responses are general phenomena for bitter-tasting substances or specific to certain substances, and they have not been rigorously studied in mice. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged exposure to a bitter compound on both recognition and rejection behaviors to the same compound in mice. Paired measurements of rejection (RjT) and apparent recognition (aR(c)T) thresholds were conducted using brief-access two-bottle choice tests before and after taste aversion conditioning, respectively. First, RjT was much higher than aR(c)T for the bitter amino acids L-tryptophan and L-isoleucine, which mice taste daily in their food, indicating strong acceptance of those familiar stimuli within the concentration range between RjT and aR(c)T. Next, we tested five other structurally dissimilar bitter compounds, to which mice were naive at the beginning of experiments: denatonium benzoate, quinine-HCl, caffeine, salicin, and epigallocatechin gallate. RjT was moderately higher than aR(c)T for all the compounds tested, indicating the presence of innate acceptance to these various, unfamiliar bitter stimuli in mice. Lastly, a 3-week forced exposure increased RjT for all the bitter compounds except salicin, demonstrating that mice acquire tolerance to a broad array of bitter compounds after long-term exposure to them. Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined, our studies provide behavioral evidence of innate and acquired tolerance to various bitter stimuli in mice, suggesting its generality among bitterants.

AB Background
   The mortality from cryptococcal meningitis remains high, despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and amphotericin-based fungal regimens. The role of neutrophils in cryptococcosis is controversial. Our objective was to examine the association between blood neutrophil counts and outcomes in terms of mortality, the incidence of bacterial infections (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and hospitalization among HIV-infected patients presenting with cryptococcal meningitis.
   Methods
   We used data from participants from the Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing (COAT) trial (2010-2012; Uganda and South Africa) and the Adjunctive Sertraline for Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis (ASTRO-CM) trial (2013-2017; Uganda). We estimated 30-day mortality risk with Cox proportional hazards models by baseline neutrophil counts (a) on a continuous scale and (b) with indicators for both relatively high (> 3,500 cells/mm(3)) and low (<= 1,000 cells/mm(3)) counts. Follow-up neutrophil counts from the COAT trial were used to examine the time-dependent association of neutrophil counts with 12-month mortality and rehospitalization.
   Results
   801 participants had an absolute neutrophil value at meningitis diagnosis. The median baseline absolute neutrophil count was 2100 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 1400 to 3300 cells/mm(3)). Baseline neutrophil count was positively associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.04-1.13, per 1000 cells/mm(3) increase; p<0.001). Baseline absolute neutrophil counts. 1000 cells/mm(3) did not have increased risk of 30-day mortality compared to those with baseline neutrophils of 1001-3500 cells/mm(3); however, baseline > 3500 cells/mm(3) had significantly increased risk, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.85(95% CI, 1.40-2.44; p<0.001). Among the COAT participants with follow-up neutrophil data, there was a strong association between time-updated neutrophil count and 12-month mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.24; p<0.001.
   Conclusion
   Higher blood neutrophil counts in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis were associated with mortality. Neutrophils role requires further investigation as to whether this may be a mediator directly contributing to mortality or merely a marker of underlying pathologies that increase mortality risk.

TI The role of public wheat breeding in reducing food insecurity in South

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; IMPACT
AB Although classified as an upper middle-income country, food insecurity is still a concern throughout South Africa, as was evident in 2014-2015 when a drought left 22% of households food insecure. Further, a range of domestic and international factors make the local currency unstable, leaving South Africa exposed to risk in global wheat and exchange rate markets and increasing its food insecurity vulnerability. As such, agricultural research in South Africa is needed specifically in plant breeding to increase yields and help mitigate future food insecurity. To foster scientific innovation for food security, the South African government funds the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), which conducts holistic research on wheat and other crops. This study estimates the proportions of increases in yield of ARC's wheat cultivars, which are attributable solely to genetic improvements. In total, 25,690 yield observations from 125 countrywide test plots from 1998 to 2014 were utilized to estimate the proportions of yield increases attributable to the ARC. We found that South African farmers who adopted the ARC's wheat varieties experienced an annual yield gain of 0.75%, 0.30%, and 0.093% in winter, facultative, and irrigated spring wheat types, respectively. Using observed area sown to ARC varieties, we estimated that wheat producers gained $106.45 million (2016 USD) during 1992-2015 via the adoption of ARC varieties. We estimated that every dollar invested in the ARC wheat breeding program generated a return of $5.10. Assuming the South African per capita wheat consumption is 60.9 kg/year, our results suggest that the ARC breeding program provided an average of 253,318 additional wheat rations from 1992-2015. Further, the net surplus (consumer plus producer) from the ARC breeding program was estimated at 42.64 million 2016 USD from 1992-2015. Public breeding programs, especially those focused on wheat and other staple foods, must continue if South Africa is to meet growing global food demand, decrease present global food insecurity, and maintain the genetic enhancements that directly enhances yield and benefits low-income consumers.

AB Plant-pollinator networks have been widely used to understand the ecology of mutualistic interactions between plants and animals. While a number of general patterns have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the structure of plant-pollinator networks are poorly understood. Here we present an agent based model (ABM) that simulates the movement of bees over heterogeneous landscapes and captures pollination events, enabling the influence of landscape pattern on pollination networks to be explored. Using the model, we conducted a series of experiments using virtual landscapes representing a gradient of forest loss and fragmentation. The ABM was able to produce expected trends in network structure, from simulations of interactions between individual plants and pollinators. For example, results indicated an increase in the index of complementary specialization (H-2') and a decline in network connectance with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, network nestedness was not associated with the degree of forest cover, but was positively related to forest patch size, further supporting results obtained in the field. This illustrates the potential value of ABMs for exploring the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator networks, and for understanding the mechanisms that underlie them. We attribute the results obtained primarily to a shift from specialist to generalist pollinators with increasing forest loss, a trend that has been observed in some field situations.

TI Culturally adaptive storytelling intervention versus didactic
   intervention to improve hypertension control in Vietnam-12 month follow
   up results: A cluster randomized controlled feasibility trial
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPORTATION
AB Introduction
   Vietnam is experiencing an epidemiologic transition with an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases. The country needs novel, large-scale, and sustainable interventions to improve hypertension control. We report the 12 month follow-up results of a cluster randomized feasibility trial in Hung Yen province, Vietnam, which evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of two community-based interventions to improve hypertension control: a "storytelling" and a didactic intervention.
   Methods
   The storytelling intervention included stories in the patients' own words about coping with hypertension and didactic content about the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviors in controlling elevated blood pressure levels. The didactic intervention included only didactic content, which were general recommendations for managing several important risk factors for hypertension and other non-communicable diseases. The storytelling intervention was delivered by two DVDs three months apart; the didactic intervention included only one DVD. The trial was conducted in patients with poorly controlled hypertension from 4 communes (communities), which were equally randomized to the two interventions.
   Results
   The mean age of the 160 patients was 66 years and 54% were men. Between baseline enrollment and the 12 month follow-up, mean systolic blood pressure declined by 10.8 mmHg (95% CI: 6.5-14.9) in the storytelling group and by 5.8 mmHg ( 95% CI: 1.6-10.0) in the didactic content group. The storytelling group also experienced more improvement in several health behaviors, including increased levels of physical activity and reduced consumption of salt and alcohol.
   Conclusions
   We observed considerable long-term beneficial effects of both interventions, especially of our storytelling intervention, among patients with inadequately controlled hypertension. A large scale randomized trial should more systematically compare the short and long-term effectiveness of the two interventions in controlling hypertension.

TI Effects of periodic sensory perturbations during electrical stimulation
   on gait cycle period
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PATTERN GENERATOR; ENTRAINMENT; LOCOMOTION; RHYTHM
AB The spinal cord contains the neural circuitry needed to generate rhythmic walking motions, and afferent sensory feedbacks are involved in the control of locomotion. In this study, we examined the influence of periodic electrical stimulation on the change in gait cycle period during treadmill walking. 40 subjects walked on a treadmill while receiving periodic bursts of electrical stimulation at various perturbation periods (-20, -40, -60, +20, +40 milliseconds from their initial gait cycle periods). Eleven subjects received electrical stimulation to the hamstring, and 29 received electrical stimulation to the calf. Each subject completed four trials; two trials were conducted using high amplitude stimulation causing a slight degree of joint motion, and the other two trials were conducted using reduced amplitude stimulation which did not cause observable motion. Through the trials, we sought to answer the following questions: 1) does the amplitude of electrical stimulation have an effect on the level of entrainment? 2) does the stimulation site effect the level of entrainment? Entrainment refers to the synchronization of gait cycle period to the period of electrical stimulation. The results showed that entrainment was observed when the perturbation periods were induced relatively close to the subject's initial gait cycle period. For both stimulation sites, entrainment was shown in 59% of subjects at +/- 20 milliseconds from the initial gait cycle period. With reduced amplitude, entrainment was still observed (51% all stimulation site groups at +/- 20 milliseconds). In addition, after-effects following electrical perturbation were present as seen by changes in the mean gait cycle period. Our results suggest that human locomotor control is organized with a semi-autonomous peripheral oscillator influenced by afferent information, and that electrical stimulation has the potential to be a simpler, and cost-effective tool for locomotion rehabilitation.

TI Neutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies following
   influenza vaccination of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; IMMUNOGENICITY; SAFETY; PROTECTION;
   MICRONEUTRALIZATION; CORRELATE; CHILDREN; VACCINES; ADULTS; ASSAYS
AB Background
   We previously reported that despite HIV-infected pregnant women had modest humoral immune responses to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) measured by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay, the observed vaccine efficacy against influenza disease was higher than predicted by HAI; suggesting that IIV may confer protection to HIV-infected individuals by additional mechanisms. We evaluated the response to IIV by microneutralization (MN) and HAI assays and correlated both methods in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women.
   Methods
   MN and HAI antibodies were measured pre-vaccination and approximately one-month post-vaccination in 80 HIV-infected and 75 HIV-uninfected women who received IIV. Geometric mean titers (GMTs), fold-change in titers and seroconversion rates were determined for the three influenza stains in the vaccine.
   Results
   After vaccination there were significant increases in MN and HAI GMTs for the three vaccine strains in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. HIV-infected women had, however, a lower immune response compared to HIV-uninfected. Fold-increases were 2 to 3-times higher for MN assay compared to HAI assay for the influenza-A strains. Also a higher percentage of women seroconverted by MN than by HAI assay for the influenza-A strains. There was high positive correlation between MN and HAI assays, except for the B/Victoria strain at pre-vaccination.
   Conclusions
   In general, the MN assay was more sensitive than the HAI assay. Microneutralization antibodies might correlate better with protection against influenza infection.

TI Associations between early term and late/post term infants and
   development of epilepsy: A cohort study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK; BIRTH; DELIVERY; AGE
AB Background
   While life-long impacts exist for infants born one or two weeks early little evidence exists for those infants born after their due date. However interventions could be used to expedite birth if the risks of continuing the pregnancy are higher than intervening. It is known that the risk of epilepsy in childhood is higher in infants exposed to perinatal compromise and therefore may be useful as a proxy for intrapartum compromise. The aim of this work is to quantify the likelihood of children developing epilepsy based on their gestational age at birth (37-39 weeks or. 41 weeks).
   Methods
   The work is based on term infants born in Sweden between 1983 and 1993 (n = 1,030,168), linked to data on disability pension, child mortality and in-patient epilepsy care. The reference group was defined as infants born at 39 or 40 completed weeks of gestation; compared with infants born at early term (37/38 weeks) or late/post term (41 weeks or more). Primary outcome was defined a-priori as a diagnosis of epilepsy before 20 years of age. Secondary outcomes were childhood mortality (before five years of age), and registered for disability pension before 20 years of age. Logistic regression models were used to assess any association of the outcomes with gestational age at birth.
   Findings
   In the unadjusted results, infants born 7 or more days after their due date had higher risks of epilepsy and disability pension than the reference group, but similar risks of child death. Early term infants showed higher risks of epilepsy, disability pension and child death. After adjustment for confounders, there remained a higher risk of epilepsy for both early term (OR 1.19 (1.11-1.29)) and late/post term infants (OR 1.13 (1.06-1.22)).
   Interpretation
   Infants born at 37/38 week or 41 weeks and above, when compared to those born at 39 or 40 weeks gestation, have an increased risk of developing epilepsy. This data could be useful in helping women and care givers make decisions with regard to the timing of induction of labour.

TI Participation in a clinical trial of a text messaging intervention is
   associated with increased infant HIV testing: A parallel-cohort
   randomized controlled trial
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION; PREVENTION
AB Objective
   Text messages significantly improve uptake of infant HIV testing in clinical trial contexts. Women who were excluded from a randomized trial in Kenya were followed to create a comparison between women who were enrolled and did not receive the study SMS intervention and women who were screened but not enrolled.
   Design
   Parallel-cohort randomized controlled trial analysis.
   Methods
   We compared time to infant HIV testing between women in three groups: the Trial SMS group, the Trial Control group, and the Comparison Cohort comprised of women who were screened but not enrolled.
   Results
   Of the 1,115 women screened, 388 (35%) were eligible for trial enrollment, and were randomized to receive either intervention text messages (Trial SMS; N = 195) or continue usual care (Trial Control; N = 193). Among 727 women not enrolled in the study (Comparison Cohort), we obtained infant HIV testing data from clinic records for 510 (70%). The cumulative probability of infant HIV testing was highest in the Trial SMS group (92.0%; 95% CI 87.5-95.3), followed by the Trial Control group (85.1%; 95% CI 79.5-89.8), and lowest among women in the Comparison Cohort (43.4%; 95% CI 39.2-47.8).
   Conclusions
   Both the Trial SMS group and the Trial Control group were significantly more likely to have their infants tested for HIV compared to the Comparison Cohort, providing evidence of a "clinical trial effect." This analysis suggests that SMS interventions should be implemented as an adjunct to consistent and engaged delivery of basic health services.

TI A maternal meal affects clinical Doppler parameters in the fetal middle

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VELOCITY WAVE-FORMS; BLOOD-FLOW; HEART-RATE; PULSATILITY INDEX;
   GESTATIONAL-AGE; NITRIC-OXIDE; GLUCOSE; GROWTH; ANEMIA; DIAGNOSIS
AB Introduction
   Middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) Doppler blood flow pulsatility indices (PIs) and MCA peak systolic velocity (PSV) are essential variables for clinically evaluating fetal well-being. Here we examined how a maternal meal influenced these Doppler blood flow velocity variables.
   Methods
   This prospective cohort study included 89 healthy Caucasian women with normal singleton pregnancies (median age, 32 years). Measurements were performed at gestational weeks 30 and 36, representing the start and near the end of the energy-depositing period. Measured variables included the MCA-PI, UA-PI, fetal heart rate (FHR) and MCA-PSV. The cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) was calculated as the ratio of MCA-PI to UA-PI. The first examination was performed in the fasting state at 08:30 a.m. Then participants ate a standard breakfast (approximate caloric intake, 400kcal), and the examination was repeated similar to 105 min after the meal.
   Results
   Without adjustment for FHR, fetal MCA-PI decreased after the meal at week 30 (-0.115; p = 0.012) and week 36 (-0.255; p < 0.001). All PI values were negatively correlated with FHR. After adjustment for FHR, MCA-PI still decreased after the meal at week 30 (-0.087; p = 0.044) and week 36 (-0.194; p < 0.001). The difference between the two gestational weeks was non-significant (p = 0.075). UA-PI values did not significantly change at week 30 (p = 0.253) or week 36 (p = 0.920). CPR revealed significant postprandial decreases of -0.17 at week 30 (p = 0.006) and -0.22 at week 36 (p = 0.001). Compared to fasting values, MCA-PSV was significantly higher after food intake: +3.9 cm/s at week 30 (p < 0.001) and +5.9 cm/s at week 36 (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion
   In gestational weeks 30 and 36, we observed a postprandial influence that was apparently specific to fetal cerebral blood flow.

TI Modification of dewetting characteristics for the improved morphology

AB Metal nanoparticles (NPs) fabricated by means of the solid state dewetting (SSD) approach are applicable in many optoelectronic, biomedical and catalytical applications. However, the fabrication of metallic NPs with the low diffusivity elements such as platinum (Pt) has been challenging for the well-defined configuration and uniformity due to the low diffusivity of Pt atoms and thus the optical properties suffer. In this paper, the evolution of well-defined configuration and improved uniformity of Pt NPs are demonstrated by the altered solid state dewetting (ASSD) approach using a sacrificial indium (In) layer. Upon annealing, the high diffusivity In atoms can lead to the formation of In-Pt alloy due to the inter-mixing at the interface and the dewetting process advances along with the enhanced diffusion of In-Pt alloy atoms. Eventually, well-defined Pt NPs are formed by means of complete desorption of In atoms by sublimation. By the control of In and Pt ratio in the bilayers with the fixed total thickness such as In-4.5 (nm)/Pt-1.5 (nm), In-3 nm/Pt-3 nm, In-1.5 nm/Pt-4.5 nm, the isolated dome shaped Pt NPs of various size are demonstrated, which reflects the significant impact of In component in the dewetting process. The optical characterization of Pt NPs exhibits the formation of quadrupolar resonance and strong dipolar resonance bands in the UV and VIS regions respectively, which are tunable based on the morphology of Pt NPs. In specific, the dipolar resonance peaks demonstrate a red shifting behavior with the increment of size of Pt NPs and gradually become narrower along with the improvement of uniformity of Pt NPs.

AB Effective symptom management is a critical component of cancer treatment. Computational tools that predict the course and severity of these symptoms have the potential to assist oncology clinicians to personalize the patient's treatment regimen more efficiently and provide more aggressive and timely interventions. Three common and inter-related symptoms in cancer patients are depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. In this paper, we elaborate on the efficiency of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis by Neural Networks (n-CCA) to predict the severity of the aforementioned symptoms between two different time points during a cycle of chemotherapy (CTX). Our results demonstrate that these two methods produced equivalent results for all three symptoms. These types of predictive models can be used to identify high risk patients, educate patients about their symptom experience, and improve the timing of pre-emptive and personalized symptom management interventions.

TI Integrative multiomics study for validation of mechanisms in

SO PLOS ONE

ID ENERGY-METABOLISM; MITOCHONDRIA; PA
AB Previous studies have suggested that exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The data from the Mayak nuclear worker cohort have indicated enhanced risk for IHD incidence. The goal of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced IHD by integrating proteomics data with a transcriptomics study on post mortem cardiac left ventricle samples from Mayak workers categorized in four radiation dose groups (0 Gy, < 100 mGy, 100-500 mGy, > 500 mGy). The proteomics data that were newly analysed here, originated from a label-free analysis of cardiac samples. The transcriptomics analysis was performed on a subset of these samples. Stepwise linear regression analyses were used to correct the age-dependent changes in protein expression, enabling the separation of proteins, the expression of which was dependent only on the radiation dose, age or both of these factors. Importantly, the majority of the proteins showed only dose-dependent expression changes. Hierarchical clustering of the proteome and transcriptome profiles confirmed the separation of control and high-dose samples. Restrictive (separate p-values) and integrative (combined p-value) approaches were used to investigate the enrichment of biological pathways. The integrative method proved superior in the validation of the key biological pathways found in the proteomics analysis, namely PPAR signalling, TCA cycle and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. This study presents a novel, improved, and comprehensive statistical approach of analysing biological effects on a limited number of samples.

AB Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are an important cause of diarrhea globally, particularly among children under the age of five in developing countries. ETEC O6 is the most common ETEC serogroup, yet the genome wide population structure of isolates of this serogroup is yet to be determined. In this study, we have characterized 40 ETEC O6 isolates collected between 1975-2016 by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and by phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing. To determine the relatedness of isolates, we evaluated two methods-whole genome high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (whole genome-hqSNP) and core genome SNP analyses using Lyve-SET and Parsnp respectively. All isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a panel of 14 antibiotics. ResFinder 2.1 and a custom quinolone resistance determinants workflow were used for resistance determinant detection. VirulenceFinder 1.5 was used for prediction of the virulence genes. Thirty-seven isolates clustered into three major clades (I, II, III) by whole genome-hqSNP and core genome SNP analyses, while three isolates included in the whole genome-hqSNP analysis only did not cluster with clades I-III by both analyses and formed a distantly related outgroup, designated clade IV. Median number of pairwise whole genome-hqSNPs in clonal ETEC O6 outbreaks ranged from 0 to 5. Of the 40 isolates tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, 18 isolates were pansusceptible. Twenty-two isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, nine of which were multidrug resistant. Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AR) correlated with AR determinants in 22 isolates. Thirty-two isolates harbored both enterotoxin virulence genes while the remaining 8 isolates had only one of the two virulence genes. In summary, whole genome-hqSNP and core genome SNP analyses from this study revealed similar evolutionary relationships and an overall diversity of ETEC O6 isolates independent of time of isolation. Less than 5 pairwise hqSNPs between ETEC O6 isolates is circumstantially indicative of an outbreak cluster. Findings from this study will be a basis for quicker outbreak detection and control by efficient subtyping by WGS.

AB The purpose of this article is to provide a scoping review of the current literature on group flow. Based on the PRISMA-guidelines for systematic reviews, 26 publications were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Publication analyses comprised an individual consideration of each publication and a systematic, integrative synthesis of all publications. Analyses identified heterogeneous group flow definitions across publications, supporting the need for an integrative definition. Further heterogeneity existed in the theoretical approaches and measures used, highlighting the need for a comprehensive theory and a measurement standard. Components (e.g., synchronization), antecedents (e.g., trust), and outcomes (e.g., well-being) of group flow were identified in publications that presented empirical studies, some of which that showed similarities between characteristics of group flow and individual flow and others that showed aspects unique to group flow. Overall, this scoping review reveals the need for a systematic research program on group flow.

AB Background
   The importance of maintaining an adequate hydration status and the complexity of the water balance make it necessary to study the lifestyle factors that can influence or modify these variables. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hydration status and dietary water intake for a sample of Spanish schoolchildren from 7 to 12 years old and their associations with physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors.
   Methods
   A total of 242 schoolchildren was studied (49.17% females). A 24-hour urine sample was collected from each child, and the urine volume and osmolality were measured to estimate the hydration status (adequate hydration <= 800 mOsm/kg). In addition, a 3-day dietary record was completed to evaluate their water intake according to EFSA parameters. Dietary information was processed with DIAL software, and a statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Student's t-test was used to study the normal variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for those that were not normal. In the case of the categorical variables, the Z and Chi-Square proportions tests were used. The Bonferroni test was used to adjust the values in multiple comparisons. To evaluate the influence of these lifestyles on the urine osmolality, a 2-way ANOVA and an odds ratio were used.
   Results
   A total of 48.3% of the sample presented an adequate hydration status, and the percentage was significantly higher in females (p = 0.003). Only 20.9% showed an adequate intake of dietary water. The lifestyle influence reveals that more inactive and non-sedentary schoolchildren were adequately hydrated (p = 0.008). PA (practice >= 1 h/day) was associated with a higher risk of having an inadequate hydration status, even when accounting for sex and other lifestyle factors (OR = 1.753(1.006-3.054), p = 0.048).
   Conclusions
   Approximately half of the participants presented an inadequate hydration status (which was higher in males than in females). PA (practice >= 1 h/day) was associated with a higher risk of inadequate hydration. This fact highlighted the importance of raising awareness about hydration in children, especially in ones who are more active.

AB Background
   Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative condition which also has effects on the heart. In 96% of affected individuals FRDA is due to homozygosity of a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene. The number of GAA repeats have been shown to relate to disease severity in FRDA, this thought to be via an inverse relationship of GAA repeat number and cellular frataxin levels. We investigated the effects of FRDA on regional long axis function of the left and right ventricles, and also the relationship of long axis systolic (s') and early diastolic (e') peak velocities with GAA repeat number on the shorter (GAA1) and longer FXN alleles (GAA2).
   Methods
   The study group of 78 adult subjects (age 32 +/- 9 years) with FRDA and normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction were compared to 54 healthy control subjects of similar age, sex and body size. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) signals were recorded at the mitral annulus for measurement of s' and e' of the septal, lateral, anterior and inferior walls and at the tricuspid annulus for measurement of right ventricular (RV) s' and e'.
   Results
   All the regional LV s' and e', and both RV s' and RV e', were lower in individuals with FRDA compared to controls (p<0.001 for all). On multivariate analysis, which included LV septal wall thickness (SWT), RV s' and RV e' were both inversely correlated with GAA1 (beta = -0.32 & -0.33, respectively, p = 0.01), but not with GAA2, whereas anterior and lateral s' were both inversely correlated with GAA2 (beta = -0.25 and beta = -0.28, p = 0.02) but not with GAA1. Increasing SWT was the most consistent LV structural correlate of lower s' and e', whereas age was a consistent inverse correlate of e' but not of s'.
   Conclusion
   There are generalized abnormalities of both LV regional and RV long axis function in FRDA, but there are also regional differences in the association of this dysfunction with the smaller and larger GAA repeats in the FXN gene.

AB Following an anterior cruciate ligament injury, premenopausal females tend to experience poorer outcomes than males, and sex hormones are thought to contribute to the disparity. Evidence seems to suggest that the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone may regulate the inflammation caused by macrophages, which invade the knee after an injury. While the individual effects of hormones on macrophage inflammation have been studied in vitro, their combined effects on post-injury inflammation in the knee have not been examined, even though both males and females have detectable levels of both estrogen and testosterone. In the present work, we developed an in silico kinetic model of the postinjury inflammatory response in the human knee joint and the hormonal influences that may shape that response. Our results indicate that post-injury, sex hormone concentrations observed in females may lead to a more pro-inflammatory, catabolic environment, while the sex hormone concentrations observed in males may lead to a more anti-inflammatory environment. These findings suggest that the female hormonal milieu may lead to increased catabolism, potentially worsening post-injury damage to the cartilage for females compared to males. The model developed herein may inform future in vitro and in vivo studies that seek to uncover the origins of sex differences in outcomes and may ultimately serve as a starting point for developing targeted therapies to prevent or reduce the cartilage damage that results from post-injury inflammation, particularly for females.

TI Short-term effects of fine particulate matter on non-accidental and
   circulatory diseases mortality: A time series study among the elder in

AB Background and objectives
   Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mu m) has multiple adverse effects on human health, especially on the respiratory and circulatory system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect of PM2.5 on the mortality risk of non-accidental and circulatory diseases, and to explore the potential effect modification by sex, education and death location.
   Methods
   We collected daily mortality counts of Changchun (China) residents, daily meteorology and air pollution data, from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2017. We focused on the elderly (>= 65 years old) population who died from non-accidental causes and circulatory diseases, and stratified them by sex, education, and death location. A generalized additive Poisson regression model (GAM) was used to analyse the impact of air pollutants on mortality. We fit single pollutant models to examine PM2.5 effects with different lag structures of single-day (distributed lag:lag0-lag3) and multi-day (moving average lag:lag01-lag03). To test the sensitivity of the model, a multi-pollutant model was established when the PM2.5 effect was strongest.
   Results
   In the single pollutant models, an increment of PM2.5 by 10 mu g/m(3) at lag0-3 was associated with a 0.385% (95% CI: 0.069% to 0.702%) increase in daily non-accidental mortality and a 0.442% (95% CI: 0.038% to 0.848%) increase in daily circulatory disease mortality. NO2 (lag1) and O-3 (lag0, lag1, lag2, lag01, lag02, lag03) were associated with daily non-accidental death and NO2 (lag1, lag3, lag03) and O-3 (lag0, lag1, lag01, lag02, lag03) were associated with daily circulatory disease mortality. In the co-pollutant models, the risk estimates for PM2.5 changed slightly. The excess mortality risk of non-accidental and circulatory diseases was higher for women, people with low education, and died outside hospital.
   Conclusions
   We found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 increased the mortality risk of non-accidental and circulatory diseases among the elderly in Changchun. Women, people with low education and died outside hospital are more susceptible to PM2.5. NO2 and O-3 were also associated with an increase in mortality from non-accidental and circulatory diseases and the O-3 is a high effect.

TI A metatranscriptomic analysis of diseased social wasps (Vespula

AB Social wasps are a major pest in many countries around the world. Pathogens may influence wasp populations and could provide an option for population management via biological control. We investigated the pathology of nests of apparently healthy common wasps, Vespula vulgaris, with nests apparently suffering disease. First, next-generation sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were used to examine pathogen presence. The transcriptome of healthy and diseased V. vulgaris showed 27 known microbial phylotypes. Four of these were observed in diseased larvae alone (Aspergillus fumigatus, Moellerella wisconsensis, Moku virus, and the microsporidian Vavraia culicis). Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV) was found to be present in both healthy and diseased larvae. Moellerella wisconsensis is a human pathogen that was potentially misidentified in our wasps by the MEGAN analysis: it is more likely to be the related bacteria Hafnia alvei that is known to infect social insects. The closest identification to the putative pathogen identified as Vavraia culicis was likely to be another microsporidian Nosema vulgaris. PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing using published or our own designed primers, confirmed the identity of Moellerella sp. (which may be Hafnia alvei), Aspergillus sp., KBV, Moku virus and Nosema. Secondly, we used an infection study by homogenising diseased wasp larvae and feeding them to entire nests of larvae in the laboratory. Three nests transinfected with diseased larvae all died within 19 days. No pathogen that we monitored, however, had a significantly higher prevalence in diseased than in healthy larvae. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that pathogen infections were significantly correlated, such as between KBV and Aspergillus sp. Social wasps clearly suffer from an array of pathogens, which may lead to the collapse of nests and larval death.

TI Enhancing simulations with intra-subject variability for improved
   psychophysical assessments
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FORCED-CHOICE; RELIABILITY; EFFICIENT; SLOPE
AB Psychometric properties of perceptual assessments, like reliability, depend on stochastic properties of psychophysical sampling procedures resulting in method variability, as well as inter- and intra-subject variability. Method variability is commonly minimized by optimizing sampling procedures through computer simulations. Inter-subject variability is inherent to the population of interest and cannot be influenced. Intra-subject variability introduced by confounds (e.g., inattention or lack of motivation) cannot be simply quantified from experimental data, as these data also include method variability. Therefore, this aspect is generally neglected when developing assessments. Yet, comparing method variability and intra-subject variability could give insights on whether effort should be invested in optimizing the sampling procedure, or in addressing potential confounds instead. We propose a new approach to estimate intra-subject variability of psychometric functions by combining computer simulations and behavioral data, and to account for it when simulating experiments. The approach was illustrated in a real-world scenario of proprioceptive difference threshold assessments. The behavioral study revealed a test-retest reliability of r = 0.212. Computer simulations without considering intra-subject variability predicted a reliability of r = 0.768, whereas the new approach including an intra-subject variability model lead to a realistic estimate of reliability (r = 0.207). Such a model also allows computing the theoretically maximally attainable reliability (r = 0.552) assuming an ideal sampling procedure. Comparing the reliability estimates when exclusively accounting for method variability versus intra- subject variability reveals that intra- subject variability should be reduced by addressing confounds and that only optimizing the sampling procedure may be insufficient to achieve a high reliability. This new approach allows computing the intra- subject variability with only two measurements per subject, and predicting the reliability for a larger number of subjects and retests based on simulations, without requiring additional experiments. Such a tool of predictive value is especially valuable for target populations where time is scarce, e.g., for assessments in clinical settings.

AB Presentation of a prototype lipid antigen alpha-Galactosylceramide (alpha GC) was examined on primary epithelial cells derived from mouse lungs and on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells that essentially comprise alveolar macrophages. Presence of CD1d molecules coupled to alpha GC was demonstrated on both types of cells pre-treated with alpha GC, suggesting that both cell types are equipped to present lipid antigens. Internalization of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG: a prototype pathogen), a pre-requisite to the processing and presentation of protein as well as lipid antigens, was clearly demonstrated in primary lung epithelial (PLE) cells as well as BAL cells. Both PLE and BAL cells expressed CD1d molecule and a significant up-regulation of its expression occurred upon infection of these cells with BCG. Besides CD1d, the expression of other important molecules that participate in lipid antigen presentation pathway (i.e. microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) and Saposin) was also significantly upregulated in PLE and BAL cells upon BCG infection. In situ up-regulation of CD1d expression on lung epithelial cells was also demonstrated in the lungs of mice exposed intra-tracheally to BCG. Taken together these results suggest that lung epithelial cells may have the ability to present lipid antigens and this pathway seems to get significantly upregulated in response to BCG infection.

AB Purpose
   To analyze the associations of retinal and choroidal thickness on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) with clinical, ophthalmic and genetic factors in the normal elderly population (aged 65 years or older).
   Methods
   In this prospective, population-based cohort study, people aged 65 years or older were enrolled in the baseline study of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) Eye Study. All participants underwent spectral domain-OCT scan using the EDI technique. A topographic map of the retina was obtained and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured manually. Blood samples from all subjects were genotyped for major age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) the major AMD-associated SNPs; CFH Y402H rs1061170, CFH I62V rs800292, ARMS2 A69S rs10490924. A statistical analysis was conducted to compare the retinal thickness, choroidal thickness, and AMD risk genotypes.
   Results
   Among the three hundred eighty people enrolled, the mean age was 76.6 years (range 6599 years). Factors that showed correlation with either tomographic retinal parameters, retinal nerve fiber layer, or SFCT, were age and gender. Significant age-related decrease in thickness was observed in the RNFL, mean central thickness (MCT) and SFCT. Gender differences existed in central foveolar thickness (CFT) and MCT, where it was thicker in men. While chorioretinal parameters were not related with other genotypes, CFH rs1061170 risk genotype was significantly associated with thin SFCT. The group containing the AMD-risk allele (CT) had a 14.7% reduction in the SFCT compared to the non-risk TT group.
   Conclusions
   In addition to the well-known association with AMD, CFH rs1061170 is a significant genetic risk factor associated with choroidal thinning in normal eyes of the elderly population. Such findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration as well as normal aging. In addition, our study provides the first normative data on retinal and choroidal thickness in population-based aged groups with a mean age over seventy-five.

AB Haplotype-based methods compete with "one-SNP-at-a-time" approaches on being preferred for association studies. Chromosome 6 contains most of the known genetic biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. Therefore, chromosome 6 serves as a benchmark for the haplotype methods testing. The aim of this study is to test the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) dataset to find out if haplotype block methods or single-locus approaches alone can sufficiently provide the significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA. In addition, could we be satisfied with only one method of the haplotype block methods for partitioning chromosome 6 of the NARAC dataset? In the NARAC dataset, chromosome 6 comprises 35,574 SNPs for 2,062 individuals (868 cases, 1,194 controls). Individual SNP approach and three haplotype block methods were applied to the NARAC dataset to identify the RA biomarkers. We employed three haplotype partitioning methods which are confidence interval test (CIT), four gamete test (FGT), and solid spine of linkage disequilibrium (SSLD). P-values after stringent Bonferroni correction for multiple testing were measured to assess the strength of association between the genetic variants and RA susceptibility. Moreover, the block size (in base pairs (bp) and number of SNPs included), number of blocks, percentage of uncovered SNPs by the block method, percentage of significant blocks from the total number of blocks, number of significant haplotypes and SNPs were used to compare among the three haplotype block methods. Individual SNP, CIT, FGT, and SSLD methods detected 432, 1,086, 1,099, and 1,322 associated SNPs, respectively. Each method identified significant SNPs that were not detected by any other method (Individual SNP: 12, FGT: 37, CIT: 55, and SSLD: 189 SNPs). 916 SNPs were discovered by all the three haplotype block methods. 367 SNPs were discovered by the haplotype block methods and the individual SNP approach. The P-values of these 367 SNPs were lower than those of the SNPs uniquely detected by only one method. The 367 SNPs detected by all the methods represent promising candidates for RA susceptibility. They should be further investigated for the European population. A hybrid technique including the four methods should be applied to detect the significant SNPs associated with RA for chromosome 6 of the NARAC dataset. Moreover, SSLD method may be preferred for its favored benefits in case of selecting only one method.

TI Bayesian change-point modeling with segmented ARMA model
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFERENCE
AB Time series segmentation aims to identify segment boundary points in a time series, and to determine the dynamical properties corresponding to each segment. To segment time series data, this article presents a Bayesian change-point model in which the data within segments follows an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. A prior distribution is defined for the number of change-points, their positions, segment means and error terms. To quantify uncertainty about the location of change-points, the resulting posterior probability distributions are sampled using the Generalized Gibbs sampler Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. This methodology is illustrated by applying it to simulated data and to real data known as the well-log time series data. This well-log data records the measurements of nuclear magnetic response of underground rocks during the drilling of a well. Our approach has high sensitivity, and detects a larger number of change-points than have been identified by comparable methods in the existing literature.

TI Myocardial Notch1-Rbpj deletion does not affect NOTCH signaling, heart

   PROTEIN; REVEALS; BINDING; MICE; CARDIOMYOCYTES; MORPHOGENESIS
AB During vertebrate cardiac development NOTCH signaling activity in the endocardium is essential for the crosstalk between endocardium and myocardium that initiates ventricular trabeculation and valve primordium formation. This crosstalk leads later to the maturation and compaction of the ventricular chambers and the morphogenesis of the cardiac valves, and its alteration may lead to disease. Although endocardial NOTCH signaling has been shown to be crucial for heart development, its physiological role in the myocardium has not been clearly established. Here we have used mouse genetics to evaluate the role of NOTCH in myocardial development. We have inactivated the unique and ubiquitous NOTCH effector RBPJ in early cardiomyocytes progenitors, and examined its consequences in cardiac development and function. Our results show that mice with Tnnt2-Cre-mediated myocardial-specific deletion of Rbpj develop to term, with homozygous mutant animals showing normal expression of cardiac development markers, and normal adult heart function. Similar observations have been obtained after Notch1 deletion with Tnnt2-Cre. We have also deleted Rbpj in both myocardial and endocardial progenitor cells, using the Nkx2.5-Cre driver, resulting in ventricular septal defect (VSD), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), due to NOTCH signaling abrogation in the endocardium of cardiac valves. Our data demonstrate that NOTCH-RBPJ inactivation in the myocardium does not affect heart development or adult cardiac function.

AB To understand the molecular processes triggered during the different steps of somatic embryogenesis (SE) in oil palm, the expression of 19 genes associated to SE identified in proteomic and transcriptomic studies was investigated by qRT-PCR. To evaluate the differential expression of these genes, two interspecific hybrid genotypes (Elaeis oleifera x Elaeis guineensis) contrasting for the acquisition of embryogenic competence were used. Aclorophyllated leaves of both hybrids, one responsive (B351733) and the other non-responsive (B352933) to SE were submitted to callus induction and collected at different time points: 0 (before induction), 14, 30, 90 and 150 days of callus induction (doi). The results obtained showed that all evaluated genes were downregulated at 14 doi in the responsive genotype when compared to the non-responsive. It was also possible to observe that most of the genes changed their expression behavior at 30 doi and were upregulated thereafter until 150 doi, with the exception of the pathogenesis-related PRB1-3-like (PRB1-3) gene, which did not show differential expression at 30 doi and was downregulated at 90 and 150 doi when compared to the non-responsive hybrid. These results indicate that 30 doi is a turning point in gene expression, probably associated to embryogenic competence acquisition. We also show that the expression behavior of the responsive genotype is more stable than that of the non-responsive when the different induction time points are compared to 0 doi (before induction). Moreover, the results obtained in this study corroborate our hypothesis that the regulation of genes involved in the control of oxidative stress and energy metabolism are crucial for the acquisition of embryogenic competence in oil palm.

TI Comparison of two column agglutination tests for red blood cell antibody
   testing
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS; GEL; AUTOANTIBODIES; ALLOANTIBODIES; PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENCE
AB Background
   Several sensitive methods are available for red blood cell (RBC) antibody screening. Among these, gel and glass card systems have demonstrated comparably good performance in retrospective studies and are widely used in routine patient diagnostics, but their performance in prospective studies has not been sufficiently characterised.
   Patients and methods
   Gel card (Bio-Rad DiaMed) and glass bead-based (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) column agglutination technologies were used to screen for antibodies prospectively (group A) and for antibody identification in stored and fresh samples known to contain RBC antibodies retrospectively (group B). Untreated reagent RBCs and either papain-treated (Bio-Rad) or ficin-treated panel C cells (Ortho) were used for antibody identification.
   Results
   RBC-reactive antibodies were detected in 22 of 1000 group A samples, three of which tested positive only by gel card agglutination, and four only by glass bead agglutination (including one false positive each). Group B comprised 202 sera with known antibodies: 33 of these samples contained 36 antibodies detected only by gel card agglutination, whereas 9 samples contained antibodies detectable only by glass bead-based agglutination. Discrepancies mostly involved weak antibodies reactive by enzyme only. Two sera contained antibody mixtures that neither system detected completely. Of note, in antibody differentiation batches one and two, anti-Lu a was reactive in 7 of 7 and 1 of 8 samples, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Both column agglutination tests for red cell antibodies had equal sensitivity and specificity with unstored samples. In stored samples, weak and enzyme-only antibodies were more frequently detected with the gel card system.

AB Children who use advanced arithmetic strategies, such as count-on and decomposition, are more accurate when solving arithmetic problems and are more likely to later have higher levels of math achievement. The present study tested the hypothesis that instruction using linear-spatial representations would activate children's knowledge necessary for use of mental addition strategies and, thus, lead to greater accuracy on addition problems, than instruction using irregular representations of magnitude. As predicted, low-income kindergartners (n = 29) randomly assigned to practice sums up to 10 using materials that instantiated the linear-spatial features of a mental number line (i.e., discrete squares arranged in rows) demonstrated substantially more improvement in solving unpracticed addition problems than children who practiced with irregular materials (i.e., pictures of stars arranged in random arrays). This was particularly true for children with better initial numerical knowledge, which provided support for the idea that existing knowledge was activated. The use of count-on more than doubled from pretest to posttest among children in the linear-spatial condition and this mediated the difference in improvement between conditions. The importance of aligning instructional materials to relevant mental representations-consistent with the Cognitive Alignment Framework for instructional design-is discussed.

   To investigate the feasibility of reduced-dose CT with IR for patients with inappropriate arm positioning
   Methods
   Twenty patients who underwent two-phase abdominopelvic CT including standard-dose and reduced-dose CT (performed with 80% of the radiation dose of the standard protocol) with their arms positioned in the abdominal area were included in this study. Reduced-dose CT images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid IR, and iterative model reconstruction (IMR). These images were compared with standard-dose CT images reconstructed with FBP. Objective image noise in the liver and subcutaneous fat was measured by standard deviation for the quantitative analysis. Then, two radiologists qualitatively assessed beam hardening artifacts, artificial texture, noise, sharpness, and overall image quality in consensus.
   Results
   Reduced-dose CT with all IR levels had lower objective image noise compared to standard-dose CT with FBP reconstruction (P < 0.05). Quantitatively measured beam hardening artifacts were similar in reduced-dose CT with iDose levels 5-6 and fewer with IMR compared to standard-dose CT. In the qualitative analysis, beam hardening artifacts and noise decreased as the IR levels increased. However, artificial texture was significantly aggravated with iDose 5-6 and IMR, and overall image quality significantly worsened with IMR.
   Conclusions
   IR algorithms can reduce beam hardening artifacts in a reduced-dose CT setting in patients with arms-down position, and an intermediate level of hybrid IR allows radiologists to obtain the best image quality. Because the retrospective and single-center nature of our study limited the number of patients, multicenter prospective clinical studies are required to validate our results.

TI Hybrid control algorithm for flexible needle steering: Demonstration in
   phantom and human cadaver
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LUNG-BIOPSY; PNEUMOTHORAX; SYSTEM; ROBOT; RISK
AB Needles are commonly used in the clinic for percutaneous procedures. The outcome of such procedures heavily depends on accurate placement of the needle. There are two main challenges to achieve high accuracy: First, aligning the needle with the targeted lesion, and second, compensating for the deflection of the needle in the tissue. In order to address these challenges, scientists have developed several robotic setups for needle steering. However, the subject is still under research and reliable implementations which can be used in clinical practice are not yet available. In this paper, we have taken some steps in order to bring needle steering closer to practice. A new hybrid control algorithm is developed, which enables us to control a flexible needle by combing base-manipulation and beveled-tip steering methods. A pre-operative path planner is developed which considers the clinical requirements. The proposed method is tested in the lung of a fresh-frozen human cadaver. The work-flow of the experiments are similar to the current clinical practice. Three experimental cases are used to evaluate the proposed steering algorithm. Experimental Case I shows that using the proposed steering algorithm controllability of the needle is increased. In Case II and Case III, the needle is steered in a gelatin phantom and a human cadaver, respectively. The targeting accuracy of 1.35 +/- 0.49mm in gelatin phantom and 1.97 +/- 0.89mm in cadave is achieved. A feasibility study is performed, in which a fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle is steered in the lungs of a human cadaver under computed tomography guidance. The targeting error for the feasibility study is 2.89 +/- 0.22mm. The results suggest that such a robotic system can be beneficial for clinical use and the patient receives less x-ray radiation.

TI Knowledge, attitudes and awareness of the human papillomavirus among
   health professionals in New Zealand
SO PLOS ONE

   INFECTION; BEHAVIORS; PARENTS; NURSES
AB Background
   Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that is implicated in 99.7% of cervical cancers and several other cancers that affect both men and women. Despite the role that HPV plays in an estimated 5% of all cancers and the evolving role of HPV vaccination and testing in protecting the public against these cancers, preliminary research in New Zealand health professionals suggest knowledge about HPV may not be sufficient.
   Methods
   A total of 230 practice nurses, smear takers and other clinical and laboratory staff who attended a range of training events completed a cross-sectional survey between April 2016 and July 2017. The survey explored four broad areas: demographics and level of experience, HPV knowledge (general HPV knowledge, HPV triage and test of cure (TOC) knowledge and HPV vaccine knowledge), attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and self-perceived adequacy of HPV knowledge.
   Results
   The mean score on the general HPV knowledge questions was 13.2 out of 15, with only 25.2% of respondents scoring 100%. In response to an additional question, 12.7% thought (or were unsure) that HPV causes HIV/AIDS. The mean score on the HPV Triage and TOC knowledge questions was 7.4 out of 10, with only 9.1% scoring 100%. The mean score on the HPV vaccine knowledge questions was 6.0 out of 7 and 44.3% scored 100%. Only 63.7% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they were adequately informed about HPV, although 73.3% agreed or strongly agreed that they could confidently answer HPV-related questions asked by patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that knowledge in each domain predicted confidence in responding to patient questions. Furthermore, the number of years since training predicted both HPV knowledge and Triage and TOC knowledge.
   Discussion
   Although overall level of knowledge was adequate, there were significant gaps in knowledge, particularly about the role of HPV testing in the New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme. More education is required to ensure that misinformation and stigma do not inadvertently result from interactions between health professionals and the public.

AB Background
   Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used in numerous consumer products. They are persistent, bioaccumulating, and suspected to be endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A growing body of research has reported the association between PFAS exposure and adverse health effects. Concerns have been raised with special focus in childhood development.
   Methods
   Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were analyzed by LC/MS/MS in serum from 1,616 pregnant women in the Swedish SELMA study. The serum samples were collected in the first trimester (median week 10). Least square geometric means (LSGM) of PFAS were estimated for each year period for, adjusted for potential determinants including parity, fish intake in the family, and mother's age.
   Results
   Six PFAS (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, PFOA, and PFOS) were detected above levels of detection (LOD) in more than 99% of the SELMA women, while PFHpA, and PFDoDA were detected above LOD in 73.4% and 46.7% respectively. Parity, maternal age, maternal smoking, and fish intake during pregnancy were found to be significantly associated (p<0.05) with serum PFAS levels in the pregnant women. Finally, serum concentration of six PFAS (PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, PFHpA, PFOA and PFOS) were significantly decreasing (range 14-31%) during the period of 30 months from 2007-2010.
   Conclusions
   Our analysis shows that six out of eight PFAS could be identified in serum of more than 99% of SELMA subjects with a significant slightly decreasing trend for five of these compounds. Furthermore, parity, higher fish intake and mothers age are determinants for serum levels of PFAS in pregnant women.

AB Differential functional specialization of the left and right hemispheres for linguistic and emotional functions, respectively, suggest that interhemispheric communication via the corpus callosum is critical for emotional awareness. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that the age-related decline in callosal connectivity mediates the frequently demonstrated reduction in emotional awareness in older age. The present study tests this hypothesis in a sample of 307 healthy individuals between 20-89 years using combined structural and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the corpus callosum. As assumed, inter-hemispheric connectivity (midsagittal callosal area and thickness, as well as fractional anisotropy, FA) and emotional awareness (i.e., increase in externally-oriented thinking, EOT; assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, TAS-20) were found to be reduced in older (> 60 years) compared to younger participants. Furthermore, relating callosal measures to emotional awareness, FA in the genu of the corpus callosum was found to be negatively correlated with EOT in male participants. Thus, "stronger" structural connectivity (higher FA) was related with higher emotional awareness (lower EOT). However, a formal mediation analysis did not support the notion that age-related decline in emotional awareness is mediated by the corpus callosum. Thus, the observed reduction of emotional awareness and callosal connectivity in older age likely reflects parallel but not inter-dependent processes.

TI An acute bout of aerobic exercise reduces movement time in a Fitts' task
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUCED AROUSAL; PERFORMANCE; SPEED; LAW
AB Movement time (MT) is one of the most important variables influencing the way we control our movements. A few previous studies have generally found that MT reduces with reaction time testing during exercise. However, limited evidence exists concerning change in MT following an acute bout of exercise. Our purpose was to investigate the effect of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on movement time as assessed by a Fitts' Law task. We also sought to determine if exercise would further lower MT during the more difficult task conditions compared with rest. Nineteen (12 male, 7 female) volunteers (19-28 yrs) completed a computerized paired serial pointing task to measure movement time before and after rest (R) and an acute bout of moderate aerobic exercise (E) using a within subjects crossover design. Comparisons between exercise and rest conditions were made to determine if there were differences in movement time. Exercise significantly reduced MT compared with rest. Movement time was reduced by an average of 208 ms following exercise compared with 108 ms following rest. Exercise did not further lower MT during the more difficult task conditions. These results suggest that an acute bout of aerobic exercise reduces movement time which is an important component of motor control. Further studies are needed to determine the duration of the effect as well as the optimum duration and intensity of exercise.

TI Transcortical photothrombotic pyramidotomy model with persistent motor

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CORTICOSPINAL TRACT; CAPSULAR INFARCT; RECOVERY; DORSAL; STROKE; RATS
AB Traditional pyramidotomy models have a high mortality rate from breathing difficulties and show early recovery from the induced motor deficits. This study establishes a novel pyramidotomy technique in Sprague Dawley rats that generates persistent motor deficits and has a reduced mortality rate. We used viral neural tracing to identify the course and relative distribution of forelimb and hindlimb motor fibers (n = 9). On basis of the neural tracing data, the medullary pyramid was targeted dorsally from the cerebellar cortex for photothrombotic infarct lesioning (n = 18). The photothrombotic technique selectively destroyed the corticospinal fibers in the medullary pyramid with relative preservation of neighboring grey-matter tissue. MicroPET imaging using 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG-microPET) showed a decrease in regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in the bilateral pyramid and ipsilateral sensory cortex (p < 0.001, FDR q < 0.05). In addition, the trapezoid bodies and superior olivary nuclei showed a decrease in rCGM, compatible with damage caused during the introduction of the optical fiber. Connected structures such as the inferior colliculi and auditory cortices also showed decreases in rCGM in both hemispheres (p < 0.001, FDR q < 0.05). There was a significant and persistent decrease in motor and sensory function in the contralateral limb following pyramidotomy, as demonstrated by performance in the single pellet reaching task and the foot-fault test. There was no operative mortality or loss of respiratory function in this study. These results indicate that photothrombotic pyramidotomy with a dorsal transcortical approach is a safe and reliable technique for generating a pyramidotomy model with persistent motor deficits.

AB Little is known about how Drosophila adults behave in the wild, including mating, allocation of food and space, and escape from predators. This lack of information has negative implications for our ability to understand the capabilities of the nervous system to integrate sensory cues necessary for the adaptation of organisms in natural conditions. We characterized a set of behavioral routines of D. melanogaster and D. simulans adults in three ecologically different orchards: grape, apple and prickly pear. We also investigated how the flies identify conspecifics and aliens in the wild to better understand relationships between group formation and adaptation of Drosophila to breeding sites. We characterized the locations by recording in each orchard humidity, temperature, illumination conditions, pH of fruits, the presence/absence of other Drosophila species and the predator ant Linepithema humile. Our findings suggest that the home range of these species of Drosophila includes decaying fruits and, principally, a variety of microhabitats that surround the fruits. The ecological heterogeneity of the orchards and odors emitted by adult D. melanogaster and D. simulans influence perch preferences, cluster formation, court and mating, egg-laying site selection, and use of space. This is one of the first large examinations of the association between changing, complex environments and a set of adult behaviors of Drosophila. Therefore, our results have implications for understanding the genetic differentiation and evolution of populations of species in the genus Drosophila.

   REATTACHMENT; VITRECTOMY; RECOVERY
AB Purpose
   To investigate the influence of subretinal injection pressure on the microstructure of the retina in a monkey model.
   Methods
   After vitrectomy, balanced salt solution was injected subretinally into one eye each of four cynomolgus monkeys while controlling the injection pressure. Initially, a pressure of 2 psi was used, and this was gradually increased to determine the minimum required pressure. Subsequent injections were performed at two pressures: minimum (n = 13) and high (n = 6). To compare the influence of these injection pressures on retinal structure, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed before surgery and every week afterwards. The monkeys were euthanized and their eyes were enucleated at 1 or 6 weeks after the injections. The eyes were processed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling.
   Results
   The minimum pressure required to perform subretinal injection was 6 psi. After injection at this pressure, both OCT and microscopy showed that the retinal structure was well-preserved throughout the experimental period at all injection sites. Conversely, after injection at high pressure (20 psi) OCT images at all injection sites showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) after 1 week. Microscopy indicated damage to the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) and stratification of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). After 6 weeks, OCT demonstrated that the EZ had become continuous and TEM confirmed that the OS and RPE had recovered. Photoreceptor apoptosis was absent after subretinal injection at both pressures.
   Conclusions
   The retinal damage caused by subretinal injection increases depending on pressure, indicating that clinicians should perform subretinal injection at pressures as low as possible to ensure safety.

DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; STRATEGIES; EXPANSION;
   SECURITY; TRENDS; WILD
AB This study investigates the effects of improved market accessibility on agricultural land use and basic wellbeing, defined by income and rice sufficiency, in Xayaburi province, Lao PDR through a meso-scale and actor-oriented approach with data collection at both district and household level. It also investigates farmers' decision-making as it relates to regional markets. Increasing market accessibility in rural areas facilitates cash crop trade leading to agrarian change from subsistence to commercial agricultural systems. This transformation raises concerns about food security and vulnerability to market uncertainties as farmers are likely to grow cash crops intensively and in place of food crops, leading to lower food production. Meanwhile incomes from cash crop trade are highly vulnerable to market uncertainties. We found that farmers in the south of Xayaburi, where market accessibility is higher than in the north, primarily grow cash crops and do not suffer from rice insufficiency while farmers in the north, where market accessibility is lower, rely more on subsistence agriculture and have a lower level of basic wellbeing. The major factors of better basic wellbeing in the south include: (1) better market accessibility which can mitigate the risks of market uncertainty and create enough income to compensate for and overcome losses in rice production, (2) availability of more arable land due to a larger amount of level terrain which allows farmers to expand cash crop cultivation and continue growing rice at the same time, and (3) farmer strategy to keep a part of their land for growing rice to meet their minimum consumption needs and prevent the risks of rice insufficiency.

AB Background and objectives
   To evaluate the Revised Sense of Coherence (SOC-R) scale in a large representative German sample.
   Design
   A nationwide household survey involving a total of 2510 face-to-face interviews.
   Methods
   In addition to the SOC-R, childhood trauma and maltreatment (CTM), lifetime traumatic events (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, CTQ, and the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, LEC-5), and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-4) were assessed.
   Results
   The final sample consisted of N = 2373 participants (52.3% females; M = 48.24 years). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed a three-factor structure for the SOC-R ('manageability', 'balance', 'reflection') with acceptable indices (RMSEA .066; 90% CI [.062, .071]). Reliability analyses revealed good internal consistency (alpha = .87). Construct validity was supported by significant but low correlations with psychopathology. Gender marginally influenced SOC-R (t = 1.99, p =.05). Moderation analyses revealed that SOC-R exerted a protective impact on depression in the context of CTQ (t = 2.29, p <.05) and lifetime traumatic events (t = -2.37, p <.05).
   Conclusions
   This study supports the psychometric properties of the SOC-R and emphasizes the importance of considering salutogenic effects to better understand interindividual differences in the effect of adversity.

TI Pre-Roman improvements to agricultural production: Evidence from

AB Domestication of wild cattle, sheep, and pigs began a process of body size diminution. In most of Western Europe this process continued across prehistory and was not reversed until the Roman period. However, in Italy, an increase in livestock body size occurred during the Iron Age, earlier than the Western provinces. In order to better understand the nature and timing of this early increase in animal size, this paper presents a detailed regional study of taxonomic abundance and biometric data from zooarchaeological assemblages recovered from the Po and Venetian-Friulian Plains in northern Italy. Our results demonstrate a high level of regionality in the choice of species exploited, with husbandry systems focused on different domesticates, as well as regional differences in animal size. However, despite significant variation in species frequencies, settlement structure, and epigraphic tradition, all areas with sufficient data demonstrate similar significant changes in livestock body size. Cattle and sheep increased incrementally in size prior to the Roman conquest in all regions considered; surprisingly, pigs continued to decrease in size throughout later prehistory. The incremental pace and pan-regional character of the size change in cattle and sheep suggests an internally motivated phenomenon rather than herd replacement with a new larger population, as might follow colonisation or conquest. The divergence in size trends for bovids and suids suggests a noteworthy change in cattle and sheep herding practices during the Iron Age or final centuries of the Bronze Age, in contrast with greater continuity in pig management. Our analysis provides a thorough zooarchaeological synthesis for northern Italy and, for the first time, demonstrates that both cattle and sheep increased in size outside of Roman territory well before the conquest of this area. This study offers a basis for future chemical analyses (DNA, isotopes), which will further investigate the cause(s) of livestock size changes in northern Italy.

AB Many different time-series methods have been widely used in forecast stock prices for earning a profit. However, there are still some problems in the previous time series models. To overcome the problems, this paper proposes a hybrid time-series model based on a feature selection method for forecasting the leading industry stock prices. In the proposed model, stepwise regression is first adopted, and multivariate adaptive regression splines and kernel ridge regression are then used to select the key features. Second, this study constructs the forecasting model by a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of support vector regression. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed models, this study collects five leading enterprise datasets in different industries from 2003 to 2012. The collected stock prices are employed to verify the proposed model under accuracy. The results show that proposed model is better accuracy than the other listed models, and provide persuasive investment guidance to investors.

   THICKNESS; DAMAGE; PHOTORECEPTORS; PATHOLOGY; DEFECTS; DEATH
AB Purpose
   Using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) the retina can be segmented automatically to visualize all retinal layers. In glaucoma chronically elevated intraocular pressure leads to a decline of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) which changes retinal architecture. The goal of these analyses was to gain insight into the changes induced by glaucoma within all macular layers using SD-OCT within a closely circumscribed glaucoma cohort.
   Materials and methods
   SD-OCT measurements with automated retinal layer segmentation were performed in both eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma patients with a defined monocular absolute visual field scotoma in the central 10 degrees of the visual field and in an age-matched healthy control group. Thickness of single retinal layers and entire retina were compared with special attention to the localization of the visual field scotoma in the glaucomatous eyes.
   Results
   30 eyes of 15 glaucoma patients and 15 eyes of 15 healthy controls were included in this study. Statistical significant thickness differences were detected in the control group between superior and inferior retina for the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the outer nuclear layer (ONL). In the glaucoma group thickness differences between worse and less affected eyes in the RNFL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the inner plexiform layers (INL) were found. Comparison between healthy and diseased eyes revealed significant thickness differences in the RNFL, GCL, IPL and total retinal thickness but not the outer retinal layers.
   Conclusion
   Comparison between SD-OCT measurements of the macula between healthy and glaucomatous eyes in a closely circumscribed disease stage showed a pronounced disease impact on the inner but not the outer retina. These results provide evidence that GCL and IPL thickness seem to be good measures to discriminate between affected and unaffected eyes in testing for glaucoma.

TI Effects of pregabalin on neurobehavior in an adult male rat model of
   PTSD
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; WATER-MAZE; ANXIETY; MEMORY
AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be a very debilitating condition. Effective approaches to prevent and treat PTSD are important areas of basic science research. Pregabalin (PGB), a gabapentinoid derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid, possesses the potential to positively affect neurobehavioral changes associated with PTSD. Using a rodent model of PTSD, the aims of this study were to determine the effects of PGB as a possible prevention for the development of PTSD-like symptoms and its use as a possible treatment. A prospective, experimental, between groups design was used in conjunction with a three-day restraint/shock PTSD stress model. Sixty rats were randomly assigned between two groups, non-stressed and stressed (PTSD). Each of the main two groups was then randomly assigned into six experimental groups: control vehicle, control PGB, control naive, PTSD vehicle, PTSD Pre-PGB (prophylactic), PTSD Post-PGB (non-prophylactic). The neurobehavioral components of PTSD were evaluated using the elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and forced swim test (FST). Pregabalin administered 24 hours before the initial PTSD event or for 10 days following the last PTSD stress event did not statistically improve mean open arm exploration on the EPM, spatial memory, and learning in the MWM or behavioral despair measured by the FST (p > 0.05).

AB We inquire whether there are race and gender differences in the recovery of missing children. We argue that race and gender differences may arise due to differential media attention, socio-economic background and police resources. Datasets used in previous research lack the representativeness and longitudinal character necessary for probing victim demographic effects on recovery success. Here we use official New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services records of all children reported missing in the period 2007-2010 containing exact dates of disappearance and recovery. In event-history analysis of these data we find that missing boys and girls have comparable daily recovery chances. Black children, however, on average remain missing longer and are more likely to still be missing by the end of our observation period than non-black children.

AB In ant communities, species coexist by using different foraging strategies. We developed an adaptive dynamics model to gain a better understanding of the factors that promote the emergence and maintenance of strategy diversity. We analysed the consequences of both interspecific competition and resource distribution for the evolutionary dynamics of social foraging in ants. The evolution of social foraging behaviour was represented using a stochastic mutation-selection process involving interactions among colonies. In our theoretical community, ant colonies inhabit an environment where resources are limited, and only one resource type is present. Colony interactions depend on colony-specific foraging strategies (defined as the degree of collective foraging), resource distribution patterns, and the degree of competition asymmetry. At the ecological timescale, we have created a model of foraging processes that reflects trade-offs between resource discovery and resource exploitation and between resource discovery and ant behavioural dominance. At the evolutionary timescale, we have identified the conditions of competition and resource distribution that can lead to the emergence and coexistence of both collective and individual foraging strategies. We suggest that asymmetric competition is an essential component in the emergence of diverse foraging strategies in a sympatric ant community.

AB Repairing damaged articular cartilage is particularly challenging because of the limited ability of cartilage to perform self-repair. Intra-articular injections of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) comprise a method of repairing full-thickness articular cartilage defects in the rabbit knee joint model. To date, the effects of administration of GlcNAc and hyaluronic acid (HA) have been investigated only in the context of osteoarthritis treatment. Therefore, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of using cell-free porous poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) graft implants and intra-articular injections of GlcNAc or HA in a rabbit model of osteochondral regeneration to investigate whether they have the potential for inducing osteochondral regeneration when used alone or simultaneously. Twenty-four rabbits were randomized into one of four groups: the scaffold-only group (PLGA), the scaffold with intraarticular injections of GlcNAc (PLGA+G) group, twice per week for four weeks; the scaffold with intra-articular injections of HA group (PLGA+HA) group, once per week for three weeks; and the scaffold with intra-articular injections of GlcNAc and HA (PLGA+G+HA) group, once per week for three weeks. Knees were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. At the end of testing, only the PLGA+G+HA group exhibited significant bone reconstruction, chondrocyte clustering, and good interactions with adjacent surfaces at 4 weeks. Additionally, the PLGA+G+HA group demonstrated essentially original hyaline cartilage structures that appeared to have sound chondrocyte orientation, considerable glycosaminoglycan levels, and reconstruction of the bone structure at 12 weeks. Moreover, the PLGA+G+HA group showed organized osteochondral integration and significantly higher bone volume per tissue volume and trabecular thickness. However, there were no significant differences between the PLGA+G and PLGA+HA groups except for gap formation on subchondral bone in the PLGA+G group. This study demonstrated that PLGA implantation combined with intra-articular injections of GlcNAc and HA allowed for cartilage and bone regeneration and significantly promoted osteochondral regeneration in rabbits without supplementation of exogenous growth factors. And the combination of this two supplements with PLGA scaffold could also prolong injection interval and better performance than either of them alone for the reconstruction of osteochondral tissue in the knee joints of rabbits.

TI Trichloroethene metabolite dichloroacetyl chloride induces apoptosis and
   compromises phagocytosis in Kupffer Cells: Activation of inflammasome

DT Article

   SUPPRESSION; EXPRESSION; PATHWAY; DISEASE; PD-L1
AB Exposure to trichloroethene (TCE), an occupational and ubiquitous environmental contaminant, is associated with the development of several autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). However, mechanisms contributing to TCE-mediated AIH are not known. Earlier, we have shown that dichloroacetyl chloride (DCAC), one of the reactive metabolites of TCE with strong acylating capability, can elicit an autoimmune response at much lower dose than TCE in female MRL+/+ mice. Furthermore, Kupffer cells (KCs), the liver resident macrophages, are crucial for hepatic homeostasis, but can also participate in the immunopathogenesis of AIH. However, contribution of KCs in TCE-mediated AIH and the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We hypothesized that increased apoptosis and delayed clearance of apoptotic bodies, due to compromised KC function, will result in the breakdown of self-tolerance, autoimmunity, and ultimately AIH. Therefore, using an in vitro model of immortalized mouse KCs, we investigated the contribution of DCAC in TCE-mediated AIH. KCs were treated with different concentrations of DCAC and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V and PI staining. Also, the impact of DCAC on phagocytic potential of KCs was evaluated. Furthermore, markers of inflammasome (NLRP3 and caspase1) were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. DCAC treatment resulted in significantly increased early and late-stage apoptosis, accompanied with inflammasome activation (NLRP3 increases). DCAC treatment resulted in decreased phagocytic function of KCs in a dose-dependent manner, with reduced MFG-E8 levels (phagocytotic function). Furthermore, DCAC exposure led to induction of phos-ERK and phos-AKT signaling. These findings suggest that DCAC induces apoptosis and inflammasome activation, while compromising the phagocytic function of KCs. Our data support that increased apoptosis and impaired KC function by DCAC could be contributory to TCE-mediated AIH.

TI A reaction-time adjusted PSI method for estimating performance in the
   stop-signal task
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESPONSE-INHIBITION
AB A central experimental task in executive control research is the Stop-signal task, which allows measuring the ability to inhibit dominant responses. A crucial aspect of this task consists of varying the delay between the Go- and Stop-signal. Since the time necessary to administer the task can be long, a method of optimal delay choice was recently proposed: the PSI method. In a behavioral experiment, we show a variant of this method, the PSI marginal method, to be unable to deal with the Go-response slowing often observed in the Stop-signal task. We propose the PSI adjusted method, which is able to deal with this response slowing by correcting the estimation process for the current reaction time. In several sets of behavioral simulations, as well as another behavioral experiment, we document and compare the statistical properties of the PSI marginal method, our PSI adjusted method, and the traditional staircase method, both when reaction times are constant and when they are linearly increasing. The results show the PSI adjusted method's performance to be comparable to the PSI marginal method in the case of constant Go-response times, and to outperform the PSI marginal method as well as the staircase methods when there is response slowing. The PSI adjusted method thus offers the possibility of efficient estimation of Stop-signal reaction times in the face of response slowing.

AB The aim of this study was to use technical skill and physical performance and coaches' rankings to predict the defensive performance of junior soccer players. Twenty-one male players (mean age 17.2 years, SD = 1.1) were recruited from the Londrina Junior Team Football Academy in Brazil. Data were collected during regular training sessions. After participants had warmed up, players were asked to either dribble the ball or sprint through five custom circuits that varied in average curvature (0-1.37 radians. m(-1)). In addition, four coaches were asked to rank the players from best to worst in defensive ability. Dribbling, sprinting, and coaches' rankings were then compared with defending performance as assessed in the one vs. one competitions (N = 1090 paired- trials: 40-65 trials per individual), in which they acted as defender or attacker in turn. When defending, the objective was to steal the ball or prevent the attacker from running around them with the ball into a scoring zone. Testing occurred over three days. Overall, dribbling performance (r = 0.56; P = 0.008) and coaches' ranking (r = 0.59; P = 0.004) were significantly related to defensive ability; sprinting performance was not (r = 0.20; P = 0.38). Though dribbling performance and coaches' ranking each explained 30% and 37% of the variance in defensive performance, respectively, the two predictors were not related (r = 0.27; P = 0.23), so combined these traits explained more than half the variance in defensive performance. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that including only one metric of closed-skill performance-dribbling speed-doubles the ability of coaches to identify their best defensive players in one vs. one scenarios.

AB Collapsing gully erosion is the main important and specific soil erosion type in the red soil region of tropical and subtropical South China. Knowledge of the soil disintegration characteristics within different weathering profiles (surface layer, red soil layer, sandy soil layer and detritus layer) and its relationships with soil particle size distribution and soil properties is important in understanding the mechanism of the forming process and development of the collapsing gully. In this paper, we conducted an experiment on four collapsing gullies located four counties (Tongcheng County, Gan County, Anxi County and Wuhua County) in the hilly granitic region of southern China. The anti-disintegration ability of the different weathering profiles with two different moisture conditions (the air-dried condition and the natural state condition) were determined by the anti-disintegration index (Kc) and measured by the submerging test. The results show that the coarse particles are higher in the sandy soil layer and the detritus layer of collapsing gully than that in the surface layer and the red soil layer, but the finer particles show the inversed order. The Kc values reduce significantly from the surface layer to the detritus layer. In the surface layer and the red soil layer, the Kc values in the natural state condition are much higher than that in the air-dried condition. The results highlight that, the sandy soil layer and the detritus layer are easily to disintegrate compare with the surface layer and the red soil layer, and in the case of low soil water content, the soil in any layer of collapsing gully is easy to disintegrate. The regression equation shows a very significant and positive relationship between the Kc values and the < 0.002 mm particles contents and the SOM (soil organic matter) (p<0.01), and negative relationship between the Kc values and the contents of other soil particle size. The results revealed that the repulsive force produced by compressed air in the soil exceeds the suction between the soil particles is the predominant factor to soil disintegrate rates in the air-dried state condition. Whereas the soil contained a certain amount of water can reduce the degree of disintegration. The results also indicated that the more contents of the cementation agents (like clay and SOM) in the soil of the different layers of collapsing gully, the higher Kc values (it means the more difficult to disintegrate).

AB Rhizophagus irregularis, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a bacterium, are microorganisms that promote plant growth. They associate with plant roots and facilitate nutrient absorption by their hosts, increase resistance against pathogens and pests, and regulate plant growth through phytohormones. In this study, eight local plant species in Finland (Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Fragaria vesca, Geranium sanguineum, Lotus corniculatus, Thymus serpyllum, Trifolium repens, and Viola tricolor) were inoculated with R. irregularis and/or B. amyloliquefaciens in autoclaved substrates to evaluate the plant growth-promoting effects of different plant/microbe combinations under controlled conditions. The eight plant species were inoculated with R. irregularis, B. amyloliquefaciens, or both microbes or were not inoculated as a control. The impact of the microbes on the plants was evaluated by measuring dry shoot weight, colonization rate by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, bacterial population density, and chlorophyll fluorescence using a plant phenotyping facility. Under dual inoculation conditions, B. amyloliquefaciens acted as a "mycorrhiza helper bacterium" to facilitate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus colonization in all tested plants. In contrast, R. irregularis did not demonstrate reciprocal facilitation of the population density of B. amyloliquefaciens. Dual inoculation with B. amyloliquefaciens and R. irregularis resulted in the greatest increase in shoot weight and photosynthetic efficiency in T. repens and F. vesca.

AB Many studies have shown that aerobic exercise improves cognitive function and maintains brain health. In particular, moderate-intensity exercise is effective for improving cognitive performance. However, there is no strong consensus on whether a single exercise session improves working memory (WM) function, as it does inhibitory function. It is possible that these discrepancies involve inter-individual differences in WM function. Therefore, we investigated whether acute mild and moderate aerobic exercise improve WM, and whether there exist inter-individual differences in improvements in WM. Thirty healthy subjects were recruited and participated in three experimental conditions (control, mild-intensity exercise, and moderate-intensity exercise). Subjects performed 10 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer with an individualized load. Their pedaling rate was maintained at 60 rpm. In the control condition, subjects rested on the cycle ergometer instead of performing exercise. The N-back task (2-back and 0-back task) was performed to assess WM function before, 5 min, and 15 min after the 10-min exercise session. In this study, to elucidate the effect of an acute bout of mild or moderate exercise on WM, the "2-back-0-back" contrast, which is assumed to represent WM function, was calculated. The Two-Dimensional Mood Scale was adopted to measure changes in psychological mood states efficiently. The results revealed that working memory function was not improved by acute mild or moderate exercise. However, baseline working memory function was significantly associated with any change in working memory function following exercise, and this was independent of exercise intensity. Subjects with the lowest working memory function at baseline responded the most favorably. The results revealed that improvements in working memory function after a single session of aerobic exercise depend on baseline working memory function.

TI The efficacy of drug induced sleep endoscopy using multimodality
   monitoring system
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID APNEA; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; PROPOFOL; CPAP
AB Introduction
   To overcome the limited readability of the conventional drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) system which only records flexible endoscopy images, we devised the Multimodality DISE System (MDS). MDS encompasses the monitoring systems for oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, snoring intensity, and patient's position. It enabled to record comprehensive situation of patients who underwent DISE. In this study, we compared the efficacy of MDS with that of the conventional DISE system.
   Methods and materials
   Ten patients underwent DISE at a tertiary hospital. DISE evaluated the airway of each patient in four positions; supine, supine with jaw thrust, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus. In addition, every examination was recorded by using both single monitoring system and MDS system. Five otolaryngologists interpreted the recorded examinations without knowledge of patient information (10 conventional DISE and 10 MDS). The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for readability, reading times, ease of patient explanation and the ease of decision making were analyzed.
   Results
   Mean VAS scores for readability of conventional DISE and MDS were 4.41+2.56 and 8.42+2.07 (p<0.001). Mean reading times for conventional DISE and MDS were 238.80+61.26 sec and 81.00+44.99 sec, respectively (p<0.001). MDS showed superiority in patient communication (p<0.001). MDS was helpful in decision making regarding patients with obstructive sleep apnea (p<0.001).
   Conclusions
   MDS enhanced the readability of previously recorded DISE and enabled easier doctor-patient communication. In addition, MDS is more effective in decision making regarding patients with OSA. MDS has laid the groundwork for separating the DISE prescriber from the DISE performer.

TI Prevalence of unmet need for contraception and its association with
   unwanted pregnancy among married women in Angola
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRENDS; BIRTH; COST; SAFE; AGE
AB Background
   Unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy are recognised as significant barriers to promoting women's reproductive health and well-being. Currently there is no research evidence on these two crucial indicators of reproductive care in Angola. Therefore, we conducted this study with the objectives of exploring the current prevalence of unmet need for contraception and unintended pregnancy as well as their relationship among married women in Angola.
   Methods
   This study was based on cross-sectional data from Angola Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2015-16. Participants were 7,808 married women aged 15-49 years. Unwanted pregnancy was measured in terms of the mistimed and unintended conception for the last-born child. Unmet need for contraception included those who reported unmet need for spacing and limiting. Data were analysed using bivariate and multivariable techniques.
   Results
   The combined prevalence of mistimed and unwanted pregnancy was 38.3% (95%CI = 35.9-40.7), and that of unmet need for contraception for spacing and limiting was 51.7% (49.9-53.5). Among the 18 regions, Luanda had the highest prevalence of unmet need for contraception and of unwanted pregnancy with the prevalence being higher than more than one-third of the women. Multivariable analysis significantly revealed a significantly positive association between unmet need and unwanted pregnancy. In all the models, the odds of unwanted pregnancy were found to be as high as four times among women with unmet need compared with those had no unmet need. Compared to women who had no unmet need, those who had unmet need had respectively four (OR = 4.380; 95%CI = 3.690-5.198) and seven (OR = 6.951; 95%CI = 4.642-10.410) times higher odds of experiencing unwanted pregnancy.
   Conclusion
   This study concludes that the prevalence of unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy are high with significant disparities across the regions. Women in the capital city had the highest prevalence of both unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy. Although the data were cross-sectional and do not indicate causal relationships, the findings showed a strong positive association between unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy. However, it is recommended to conduct further studies to replicate the findings and to explore the influence behavioural and cultural practices on unwanted pregnancy.

AB Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the culprit behind the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), is a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated anion channel. Studies of human CFTR over the past two decades have provided an in-depth understanding of how CFTR works as an ion channel despite its structural resemblance to ABC transporters. Recently-solved cryo-EM structures of unphosphorylated human and zebrafish CFTR (hCFTR and zCFTR), as well as phosphorylated ATP-bound zebrafish and human CFTR offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand CFTR's function at a molecular level. Interestingly, despite millions of years of phylogenetic distance between human and zebrafish, the structures of zCFTR and hCFTR exhibit remarkable similarities. In the current study, we characterized biophysical and pharmacological properties of zCFTR with the patch-clamp technique, and showed surprisingly very different functional properties between these two orthologs. First, while hCFTR has a single-channel conductance of 8.4 pS with a linear I-V curve, zCFTR shows an inwardly-rectified I-V relationship with a single-channel conductance of similar to 3.5 pS. Second, single-channel gating behaviors of phosphorylated zCFTR are very different from those of hCFTR, featuring a very low open probability P-o (0.03 +/- 0.02, vs. similar to 0.50 for hCFTR) with exceedingly long closed events and brief openings. In addition, unlike hCFTR where each open burst is clearly defined with rare short-lived flickery closures, the open bursts of zCFTR are not easily resolved. Third, although abolishing ATP hydrolysis by replacing the catalytic glutamate with glutamine (i.e., E1372Q) drastically prolongs the open bursts defined by the macroscopic relaxation analysis in zCFTR, the Po within a "locked-open" burst of E1372Q-zCFTR is only similar to 0.35 (vs. P-o > 0.94 in E1371Q-hCFTR). Collectively, our data not only provide a reasonable explanation for the unexpected closed-state structure of phosphorylated E1372Q-zCFTR with a canonical ATP-bound dimer of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), but also implicate significant structural and functional differences between these two evolutionarily distant orthologs.

AB The objective of the study was to develop an ex-vivo PK/PD model of intramuscular (IM) administration of tulathromycin and to test its efficacy against Haemophilus parasuis (H. parasuis) infection in intraperitoneal-inoculated neutropenic guinea pigs. The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of tulathromycin at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg in H. parasuis-infected neutropenic guinea pig were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). In vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), mutant prevention concentration (MPC), post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and dynamic time-kill curve experiments were carried out using H. parasuis strain 13R. Tulathromycin exhibited concentration-dependent activity and PAE persisted long after administration of the antibiotic. The ratio of the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to MIC in serum (AUC(24h)/MICserum) was recognized as an important PK/PD parameter that positively correlated with the in vitro antibacterial effectiveness of tulathromycin (R-2 = 0.9961 or R-2 = 1). For the 1 and 10 mg/kg treatments with tulathromycin, the values of AUC(24h)/MIC for H. parasuis bacteriostatic action, bactericidal action and virtual bacterial eradication were respectively 22.73, 34.5 and 88.03 h for the 1 mg/kg treatment and respectively 24.94, 30.94 and 49.92 h for the 10 mg/kg treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that doses of 7.2-8.0 mg/kg of tulathromycin resulted in high eradication rates (99.99%). Using a previously published conversion factor of 0.296, we were able to estimate an approximate dose, 2.1-2.4 mg/kg, that should also obtain high eradication rates in the target animal, pigs. This study can help optimize tulathromycin efficacy against H. parasuis infections in swine farming.

AB Background
   Many blood markers have been shown to predict the recurrence and survival of various malignancies, but the effects of surgery on the body's inflammatory levels may cause changes in these inflammatory markers. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the relationship between changes in platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and survival and recurrence in patients with T3-T4 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).
   Methods
   Data of patients with T3-T4 HSCC were reviewed. Continuous variables were expressed as mean +/- SD and were compared using t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The covariate distributions were compared by Chi-square test. Survival curve was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Log-Rank test were performed to estimate the survival curve and significance of the difference in survival distribution between groups, respectively. The prognostic value was uncovered by univariate and multivariate Cox hazards analysis.
   Results
   The 413 consecutive patients with LSCC were reviewed. Of these, 362 patients who met the criteria were selected, multi-factor analysis found that pathological T classification(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.878; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.342-3.023; P<0.001), pathological N classification (HR = 1.212; 95% CI = 0.867-2.125; P<0.001) and change of PLR (HR = 2.158; 95% CI = 1.332-2.889; P = 0.004) associated with postoperative recurrence of T3-T4 LSCC. In addition, the pathological T classification (HR = 1.901; 95% CI = 1.255-2.999; P<0.001), pathological N classification (HR = 1.244; 95% CI = 0.810-2.212; P<0.001) and change of PLR (HR = 2.011; 95% CI = 1.354-2.753; P = 0.001) associated with postoperative survival in patients with T3-T4 LSCC.
   Conclusions
   Results demonstrate that change in PLR may serve as a useful prognostic predictor for patients with T3-T4 LSCC.

TI Drug resistance characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates
   between 2014 and 2017 in Sichuan, China: A retrospective study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTED PATIENTS; MTB/RIF
AB Background
   The prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) has brought severe challenges to the prevention and control of tuberculosis. Studies have explored the status of antituberculosis drug (ATD) resistance in different regions of China. However, few studies have focused on DR-TB in Sichuan to date. Due to the large population in Sichuan, detailed investigations of the DR-TB burden in Sichuan are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the drug resistance characteristics of TB isolates from tuberculosis patients with and without HIV (TB-HIV patients and TBw/oHIV patients) in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
   Methods
   Isolates from respiratory samples of TBw/oHIV patients and TB-HIV patients hospitalized between January 2014 and December 2017 were collected. Nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) were excluded. Drug sensitivity testing (DST) was performed according to the dilution method in microplates with 4 first-line ATDs and 8 second-line ATDs. TB strains were separated according to patient treatment history, patient age, calendar year and GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) assay results for further analysis.
   Results
   For the 7470 patients recruited, the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) rate was 2.1-fold (14.6% vs. 6.8%) higher than the national baseline level. The repeatedly admitted patients were more likely to have a resistance profile than the first-time-admitted cases inboth the TB-only group (P<0.05) and the TB-HIV corresponding group (P<0.05). Among the 7273 TBw/oHIV cases and 197 TB-HIV cases, the positivity rates of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the TB-HIV group were significantly lower than those in the TBw/oHIV group (P<0.05). The repeatedly admitted TB-HIV patients had lower resistance rates to INH than the repeatedly admitted TBw/oHIV patients (24.4% vs. 41.5%, P<0.05). The Rifampicin-resistant TB strains in the TBw/oHIV group were more likely to be resistant to INH in the repeatedly admitted group than those in the first-time admitted patients (P<0.05). The proportions of XDR (3.6% vs. 1.3%, P<0.05) and XDR-TB/MDR-TB (7.3% vs. 2.2%, P<0.05) in all TB-HIV patients were significantly higher than those in all TBw/oHIV patients. The ratio of XDR-TB was significantly higher in the TB-HIV group than in the TBw/oHIV group (30.4% vs. 9.0%, P<0.05) and the all TB group (9.0% vs. 10.1%, P<0.05). Regarding age, the <25-year-old TB-HIV patients (9.1% vs. 0.7%, P<0.05) and 25 similar to 44-year-old TB-HIV patients (5.2% vs. 2.4%, P<0.05) were more likely to have a higher XDR proportion than their TBw/oHIV counterparts. The ATD-resistance profile in terms of different years from high to low was 2014>2015>2016 approximate to 2017 for TBw/oHIV patients. The same trend was also observed for TB-HIV patients: 2014>2015>2016 approximate to 2017. The GeneXpert TB-positive rate in the TBw/oHIV group was higher than that in the TB-HIV group [81%(639/792) vs. 65% (13/20), P<0.05]. In TBw/oHIV cases, the agreement was 92.3% and the Kappa value was 0.75. In TB-HIV cases, the agreement was 85.0% and the Kappa value was 0.32.
   Conclusion
   In Sichuan, ATD resistance has improved since 2014, but to date, it remains severe. The different resistance profiles of TBw/oHIV patients and TB-HIV patients indicates the need for personalized treatment plans. Specifically, the GeneXpert assay might be more suitable for TBw/oHIV patients than for TB-HIV patients.

AB The imbalance in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. When attempting to identify gene expression profiles using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the selection of suitable reference genes is important. Here, the expression levels of 10 commonly used reference genes were assessed for normalization of RT-qPCR in Hcy-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and control cells. The suitability of eight selected candidate genes was comparatively analyzed across the tested samples and separately ranked by four programs, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the Delta Ct method. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was the most stable gene in the final ranking using the RankAggreg package. Surprisingly, the beta-actin (ACTB) levels decreased significantly in Hcy-treated HUVECs compared with control HUVECs (P<0.05), and further study indicated that Hcy suppressed the expression of ACTB by upregulating the miR-145-5p level in Hcy-treated HUVECs. Our data suggest that GAPDH can be used as a reliable reference gene, while ACTB cannot; normalization of gene expression in RT-qPCR experiments in Hcy-treated HUVECs. The data, which identifies a suitable reference gene in Hcy-treated HUVECs, will contribute to the design of an effective and accurate method for quantitation of gene expression.

TI Detection of bitterness and astringency of green tea with different
   taste by electronic nose and tongue
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SENSORY EVALUATION; QUALITY; PREDICTION; BLACK
AB An electronic nose was used to evaluate the bitterness and astringency of green tea, and the possible application of the sensor was assessed for the evaluation of different tasting green tea samples. Three different grades of green tea were measured with the electronic nose and electronic tongue. The sensor array of the E-nose was optimized by correlation analysis. The relationship between the signal of the optimized sensor array and the bitterness and astringency of green tea was developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN). BPNN is a multilayer feedforward neural network trained by an error propagation algorithm. The results showed that the BPNN model possessed good ability to predict the bitterness and astringency of green tea, with high correlation coefficients (R = 0.98 for bitterness and R = 0.96 for astringency) and relatively lower root mean square errors (RMSE) (0.25 for bitterness and 0.32 for astringency) for the calibration set. The R value is 0.92 and 0.87, and the RMSE is 0.34 and 0.55, for bitterness and astringency, respectively, of the prediction set. These results indicate that the electronic nose could be used as a feasible and reliable method to evaluate the taste of green tea. These results can provide a theoretical reference for rapid detection of the bitter and astringent taste of green tea using volatile odor information.

AB DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious lesions that can arise in cells after ionizing radiation or radiometric drug treatment. In addition to prompt DSBs, DSBs may also be produced during repair, evolving from a clustered DNA damaged site, which is composed of two or more distinct lesions that are located within two helical turns. A specific type of cluster damage is the heat-sensitive clustered site (HSCS), which transforms into DSBs upon treatment at elevated temperatures. The actual lesions or mechanisms that mediate the HSCS transformation into DSBs are unknown. However, there are two possibilities; either these lesions are transformed into DSBs due to DNA lesion instability, e.g., transfer of HSCS into single-strand breaks (SSBs), or they are formed due to local DNA structure instability, e.g., DNA melting, where two SSBs on opposite strands meet and transform into a DSB. The importance of these processes in living cells is not understood, but they significantly affect estimates of DSB repair capacity. In this study, we show that HSCS removal in human cells is not affected by defects in DSB repair or inhibition of DSB repair. Under conditions where rejoining of prompt DSBs was almost completely inhibited, heat-sensitive DSBs were successfully rejoined, without resulting in increased DSB levels, indicating that HSCS do not transfer into DSB in cells under physiological conditions. Furthermore, analysis by atomic force microscopy suggests that prolonged heating of chromosomal DNA can induce structural changes that facilitate transformation of HSCS into DSB. In conclusion, the HSCS do not generate additional DSBs at physiological temperatures in human cells, and the repair of HSCS is independent of DSB repair.

AB Experimental stroke in rodents, via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), can be associated with a negative impact on wellbeing and mortality. In hypertensive rodents, pre-stroke craniotomy increased survival and decreased body weight loss post-MCAO. Here we determined the effect, in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats following 60 minutes MCAO, with or without pre-surgical craniotomy, on post-stroke outcomes in terms of weight loss, neurological deficit, lesion volume and functional outcomes. There was no effect of pre-stroke craniotomy on indicators of wellbeing including survival rate (P = 0.32), body weight loss (P = 0.42) and neurological deficit (P = 0.75). We also assessed common outcome measures following experimental stroke and found no effect of pre-stroke craniotomy on lesion volume as measured by T2-weighted MRI (P = 0.846), or functional performance up to 28 days post-MCAO (staircase test, P = 0.32; adhesive sticker test, P = 0.49; cylinder test, P = 0.38). Thus, pre-stroke craniotomy did not improve animal welfare in terms of body weight loss and neurological deficit. However, it is important, given that a number of drug delivery studies utilise the craniotomy procedure, to note that there was no effect on lesion volume or functional outcome following experimental stroke.

AB Introduction
   Past research has shown relationships between stress during pregnancy, and related psychosocial health measures such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, with infant, child, and adult outcomes. However, most research is from high-income countries. We conducted a scoping review to identify research studies on prenatal stress and outcomes of the pregnancy or offspring in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and to synthesize the stress measures and outcomes assessed, the findings observed, and directions for future research.
   Methods
   We searched PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for English-language abstracts published from Jan 1960-Jan 2017. Search terms were related to stress and psychosocial health; pregnancy; infant or child development; and LMICs.
   Results
   48 articles were identified. Sixty percent of studies were in upper-middle, 25% in lower-middle, and 15% in low income countries. Most studies used questionnaires, either existing or tailor-made, to assess stress. Eight assessed cortisol. Most studies (n = 31) assessed infant outcomes at birth, particularly gestational age or preterm birth (n = 22, 12 showing significant relationships), and birthweight (n = 21, 14 showing significant relationships). Five studies analyzed outcomes later in infancy such as temperament and motor development, all showing significant results; and nine in childhood such as behavioral development, asthma, and physical growth, with eight showing significant results.
   Conclusions
   Results highlight the importance of prenatal stress on infant and child outcomes in LMICs. Methods used in high-income countries are successfully employed in LMICs, but tailored tools remain necessary. Careful assessment of covariates is needed to foster analyses of interactive effects and pathways. Studies including longer-term follow-up should be prioritized.

AB Assessment of lameness in cattle after foot surgery is important to monitor the recovery period, to improve the long-term success and the cows` welfare. This longitudinal multicenter retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of automated tools of weight bearing and gait analysis following foot surgery to support the clinician to monitor lameness in cattle. For this purpose, the effect of involvement of different anatomical structures and the use of different surgery methods on gait parameters of post-operative recovery was assessed. The study consisted of 2 experiments and included cattle with unilateral foot pathologies located in the digital region which needed 1 (experiment 1; n = 30) or 2 (experiment 2; n = 4) surgical interventions. The surgical techniques were debridement, joint lavage, partial resection of bones, tendons or synovial structures, total resection of the sesamoid bone and digit amputation. Two accelerometers (400 Hz; kinematic outcome = stance phase duration; kinetic outcome = foot load and toe-off), a 4-scale weighing platform (difference of mean weight distribution across the limbs; Delta(weight)) and a subjective locomotion score were used to evaluate gait parameters every 3 to 4 days after surgery. A repeated measures ANOVA was used in experiment 1 and a receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values in experiment 2. Results showed that the differences across limbs for the pedogram variables of stance phases and peaks of foot load and toe-off, Delta(weight) and the locomotion score were highest if joints or sesamoid bones were involved, suggesting that these cattle were more severely lame compared to cattle with more superficial foot pathologies. There was a significantly lower degree of lameness after surgical debridement and after digit amputation compared to partial and total resection of anatomical structures of the foot. The use of accelerometers and a 4-scale weighing platform represent promising objective tools for post-operative monitoring of lameness and can support the clinician in gait assessment to improve the long-term success of surgical interventions in the area of the foot.

AB This paper analyzes distributional properties that facilitate the categorization of words into lexical categories. First, word-context co-occurrence counts were collected using corpora of transcribed English child-directed speech. Then, an unsupervised k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to categorize words into lexical categories. The categorization outcome was regressed over three main distributional predictors computed for each word, including frequency, contextual diversity, and average conditional probability given all the co-occurring contexts. Results show that both contextual diversity and frequency have a positive effect while the average conditional probability has a negative effect. This indicates that words are easier to categorize in the face of uncertainty: categorization works best for words which are frequent, diverse, and hard to predict given the co-occurring contexts. This shows how, in order for the learner to see an opportunity to form a category, there needs to be a certain degree of uncertainty in the co-occurrence pattern.

AB The life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent responsible for malaria, depends on both cytosolic and apicoplast translation fidelity. Apicoplast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are bacterial-like enzymes devoted to organellar tRNA aminoacylation. They are all encoded by the nuclear genome and are translocated into the apicoplast only after cytosolic biosynthesis. Apicoplast aaRSs contain numerous idiosyncratic sequence insertions: An understanding of the roles of these insertions has remained elusive and they hinder efforts to heterologously overexpress these proteins. Moreover, the A/T rich content of the Plasmo-dium genome leads to A/U rich apicoplast tRNA substrates that display structural plasticity. Here, we focus on the P. falciparum apicoplast tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Pf-apiTyrRS) and its cognate tRNA(Tyr) substrate (Pf-apitRNA(Tyr)). Cloning and expression strategies used to obtain an active and functional recombinant Pf-apiTyrRS are reported. Functional analyses established that only three weak identity elements in the apitRNA(Tyr) promote specific recognition by the cognate Pf-apiTyrRS and that positive identity elements usually found in the tRNA(Tyr) acceptor stem are excluded from this set. This finding brings to light an unusual behavior for a tRNA(Tyr) aminoacylation system and suggests that Pf-apiTyrRS uses primarily negative recognition elements to direct tyrosylation specificity.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID BIOPSY; GUIDELINES; ALGORITHM; ANTIGEN; RISK
AB Purpose
   The aim of this study was to evaluate predictors of residual tumor and clinical prognosis in T1a-T1b (incidental) prostate cancer by analysis of specimens from men undergoing surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
   Materials and methods
   We retrospectively reviewed medical records of incidental prostate cancer patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Patients whose tumor statuses were further confirmed by prostate biopsy, or who had used androgen deprivation therapy before radical prostatectomy, were excluded. Clinical and pathological parameters were analyzed to evaluate residual tumor and clinical prognosis. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, as well as receiver operator characteristics, to predict residual tumor (pT0).
   Results
   The final analysis included 95 patients. Among these patients, 67 (70.53%) exhibited residual tumor, whereas 28 (29.47%) did not (pT0). Pathology findings showed that 44 (65.67%), 16 (23.88%), and 7 patients (10.45%) exhibited Gleason scores of G6, G7, and >= G8, respectively. Fifty-seven and 10 patients exhibited pathologic T stages T2 and T3, respectively. Mean follow-up duration was 70.26 (+/- 34.67) months. Biochemical recurrence was observed in 11 patients; none were pT0 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that low prostate-specific antigen density after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery and invisible lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were significantly associated with pT0. Additionally, a combination of these factors showed an increase in the diagnostic accuracy of pT0, compared with mpMRI alone (AUC 0.805, 0.767, respectively); this combination showed sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 71.6%, 89.3%, and 94.1%, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that patients with incidental prostate cancer who have both prostate-specific antigen density <= 0.08 after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery as well as invisible cancer lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging should be considered for active surveillance.

Understanding the prevalence of such infections and the underlying genetic mechanisms of resistance may help in the implementation of adequate measures to control and prevent acquisition of nosocomial infections, especially in an intensive care unit setting. This study describes the molecular characteristics and risk factors associated with OXA-23-producing A. baumannii infections. A case-control study was undertaken from September/2013 to April/2015. Acquisition of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii was found to be associated with the use of nasogastric tubes, haemodialysis, and the use of cephalosporins. These isolates were only susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, tigecycline, and colistin, and contained the ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-51) genes. Twenty-six OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains belonged to the ST79 (CC79) clonal group, and patients infected or colonised by these isolates had a higher mortality rate (34.6%). In conclusion, this study showed a dissemination of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains that was associated with several healthcare-related risk factors and high mortality rates among intensive care unit patients.

AB Introduction
   Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgical procedure associated with high morbidity and prolonged length of stay. Enhanced recovery after surgery principles have reduced complications rate and length of stay for multiple types of operations. We hypothesized that implementation of a standardized perioperative care pathway would facilitate safe discharge by five days after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
   Methods
   We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy 18 months prior to and 18 months following implementation of a perioperative care pathway at a quaternary center performing high volume pancreatic surgery.
   Results
   A total of 145 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (mean age 63 +/- 10 years, 52% female), 81 before and 64 following pathway implementation, and the groups were similar in terms of preoperative comorbidities. The percentage of patients discharged within <= 5 days of surgery increased from 36% to 64% following pathway implementation (p = 0.001), with no observed differences in post-operative serious adverse events (p = 0.34), pancreatic fistula grade B or C (p = 0.28 and p = 0.27 respectively), or delayed gastric emptying (p = 0.46). Multivariate regression analysis showed length of stay. 5 days three times more likely after pathway implementation. Rates of readmission within 30 days (20% pre-vs. 22% post-pathway (p = 0.75)) and 90 days (27% pre-vs. 36% post-pathway (p = 0.27)) were unchanged after pathway implementation, and were no different between patients discharged before or after day 5 at both 30 days (19% <= 5 days vs. 23% >= 6 days (p = 0.68)) and 90 days (32% <= 5 days vs. 30% >= 6 days (p = 0.81)).
   Conclusions
   Standardizing perioperative care via enhanced recovery protocols for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy facilitates safe discharge by post-operative day five.

AB Purpose
   To assess depth-dependent corneal displacements in live normal subjects using optical coherence elastography (OCE).
   Methods
   A corneal elastography method based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) was implemented in a clinical prototype. Low amplitude corneal deformation was produced during OCT imaging with a linear actuator-driven lens coupled to force transducers. A cross-correlation algorithm was applied to track frame-by-frame speckle displacement across horizontal meridian scans. Intra-measurement force and displacement data series were plotted against each other to produce local axial stiffness approximations, k, defined by the slope of a linear fit to the force/displacement data (ignoring non-axial contributions from corneal bending). Elastographic maps displaying local k values across the cornea were generated, and the ratio of mean axial stiffness approximations for adjacent anterior and posterior stromal regions, k(a)/k(p), was calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to estimate repeatability.
   Results
   Seventeen eyes (ten subjects) were included in this prospective first-in-humans translational study. The ICC was 0.84. Graphs of force vs. displacement demonstrated that, for simultaneously acquired measurements involving the same applied force, anterior stromal displacements were lower (suggesting stiffer behavior) than posterior stromal displacements. Mean k(a) was 0.016 +/- 0.004 g/mm and mean k(p) was 0.014 +/- 0.004 g/mm, giving a mean k(a)/k(p) ratio of 1.123 +/- 0.062.
   Conclusion
   OCE is a clinically feasible, non-invasive corneal biomechanical characterization method capable of resolving depth-dependent differences in corneal deformation behavior. The anterior stroma demonstrated responses consistent with stiffer properties in compression than the posterior stroma, but to a degree that varied across normal eyes. The clinical capability to measure these differences has implications for assessing the biomechanical impact of corneal refractive surgeries and for ectasia risk screening applications.

TI Establishment of a bioluminescent canine B-cell lymphoma xenograft model
   for monitoring tumor progression and treatment response in preclinical
   studies
SO PLOS ONE

ID NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA; DOGS; LINE
AB Canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common cancers in dogs which shares remarkable similarities with its human counterpart, making the dog an excellent model for the investigation of novel therapeutic agents. However, the integration of canine lymphoma in comparative studies has been limited due in part to the lack of suitable xenograft mouse models for preclinical studies. To overcome these limitations, we established and characterized a localized subcutaneous bioluminescent canine DLBCL xenograft mouse model. The canine CLBL-1 cell line stably expressing the luciferase and green fluorescent protein reporters was generated and used to establish the xenograft tumor model. A pilot study was first conducted with three different cell densities (0.1x10(6), 0.5x10(6) and 1x10(6) cells) in SCID mice. All mice presented homogeneous tumor induction within eight days after subcutaneous injection, with a 100% engraftment efficiency and no significant differences were observed among groups. The tumors were highly aggressive and localized at the site of inoculation and reproduced histological features and immunophenotype consistent with canine DLBCL. Importantly, xenograft tumors were detected and quantified by bioluminescent imaging. To assess response to therapy, a therapeutic study with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat, was performed. The results demonstrated that panobinostat (20 mg/kg) efficiently inhibited tumor growth and that bioluminescent imaging allowed the monitorization and quantification of tumor response to therapy. In summary, this study provides a bioluminescence canine DLBCL model that offers high engraftment efficiency, preservation of tumor features, and noninvasive monitoring of tumor progression, validating the model as a promising preclinical tool for both veterinary and human medicine.

AB Mitochondria are central organelles in cellular metabolism. Their structure is highly dynamic, allowing them to adapt to different energy requirements, to be partitioned during cell division, and to maintain functionality. Mitochondrial dynamics, including membrane fusion and fission reactions, are well studied in yeast and mammals but it is not known if these processes are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Kinetoplastid parasites are some of the earliest-diverging eukaryotes to retain a mitochondrion. Each cell has only a single mitochondrial organelle, making them an interesting model for the role of dynamics in controlling mitochondrial architecture. We have investigated the mitochondrial division cycle in the kinetoplastid Crithidia fasciculata. The majority of mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the mitochondrion is divided symmetrically in a process coincident with cytokinesis. Live cell imaging revealed that the mitochondrion is highly dynamic, with frequent changes in the topology of the branched network. These remodeling reactions include tubule fission, fusion, and sliding, as well as new tubule formation. We hypothesize that the function of this dynamic remodeling is to homogenize mitochondrial contents and to facilitate rapid transport of mitochondria-encoded gene products from the area containing the mitochondrial nucleoid to other parts of the organelle.

AB Background
   In patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) a cardinal feature is exercise intolerance, often associated with significant dyspnea and severe hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen therapy may be offered during exercise. The Oxymizer is a nasal cannula with an incorporated reservoir with the potential to deliver higher oxygen doses to the patient.
   Objective
   The primary aim was to investigate the effect of supplemental oxygen delivered via Oxymizer compared to a conventional nasal cannula (CNC) in patients with ILD during constant work rate tests (CWRT). Secondary aim was to evaluate effects on oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), dyspnea and heart rate at isotime.
   Methods
   In this randomized crossover study 24 ILD patients established on long-term oxygen treatment were included. Patients performed four cycling CWRT at 70% of their peak work rate; twice with the Oxymizer and twice with the CNC.
   Results
   Twenty-one patients finished all CWRTs (age 60 +/- 10.9 years, VC 55.4 +/- 23.0% predicted). Cycle endurance time was significantly higher while using the Oxymizer compared to CNC (718 +/- 485 vs. 680 +/- 579 seconds, p = 0.02), and SpO(2) at isotime was significantly higher while using the Oxymizer (85.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 82.8 +/- 7.2, p = 0.01). Fifteen of the 21 (71%) patients cycled longer with the Oxymizer. There were no significant differences for dyspnea and heart rate.
   Conclusions
   Supplemental oxygen provided by the Oxymizer significantly, but modestly, improved cycle endurance time and SpO(2) at isotime in ILD patients compared to CNC.

AB It can be difficult to recognise new instances of an unfamiliar face. Recognition errors in this particular situation appear to be viewpoint dependent with error rates increasing with the angular distance between the face views. Studies using front views for comparison have shown that recognising faces rotated in yaw can be difficult and that recognition of faces rotated in pitch is more challenging still. Here we investigate the extent to which viewpoint dependent face recognition depends on the comparison view. Participants were assigned to one of four different comparison view groups: front, 3/4 yaw (right), 3/4 pitch-up (above) or 3/4 pitch-down (below). On each trial, participants matched their particular comparison view to a range of yaw or pitch rotated test views. Results showed that groups with a front or 3/4 yaw comparison view had superior overall performance and more successful generalisation to a broader range of both pitch and yaw test views compared to groups with pitch-up or pitch-down comparison views, both of which had a very restricted generalisation range. Regression analyses revealed the importance of image similarity between views for generalisation, with a lesser role for 3D face depth.

TI Aortic valve calcium score in hypercholesterolemic patients with and

AB The aim of this study was a comparison of aortic valve calcium score (AVCS) between patients with hypercholesterolemia and genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia with low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutation (LDLR-M group), versus patients with hypercholesterolemia without LDLR gene mutation (LDLR-WT group). A total of 72 LDLR-M patients and 50 LDLR-WT patients were enrolled in the study and underwent CT as a part of an assessment of coronary calcium scoring. AVCS was determined and compared between the two patient groups. AVCS was significantly higher in the LDLR-M group in comparison to the LDLR-WT group (13.8 +/- 37.9 vs. 0.94 +/- 3.1, p = 0.03). The Yates' chi-squared test for independence revealed that LDLR mutation and AVCS were significantly dependable (Chi boolean AND 2 = 6.106, p = 0.013). The LDLR mutation was a strong predictor of a high AVCS (OR 7.83, 95% CI 2.08-29.50, p = 0.002) on multivariate regression analysis. Among the traditional risk factors, age (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.18, p<0.001) and SBP (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07, p = 0.045) were also significant for high result of AVCS. An assessment of computed tomography calcium scores showed that LDLR-M patients have increased AVCS in comparison to those with LDLR-WT. In addition, LDLR mutation can be considered as an independent risk factor of having high AVSC even after adjustment for risk factors including cholesterol levels. This may result from the associated process connected with the regulatory role of LDLR in evolution of aortic valve calcifications.

TI Choosing important health outcomes for comparative effectiveness
   research: 4th annual update to a systematic review of core outcome sets
   for research
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
AB Background
   The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database is a publically available, searchable repository of published and ongoing core outcome set (COS) studies. An annual systematic review update is carried out to maintain the currency of database content.
   Methods
   The methods used in the fourth update of the systematic review followed the same approach used in the original review and previous updates. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported the development of a COS, regardless of any restrictions by age, health condition or setting. Searches were carried out in March 2018 to identify studies that had been published or indexed between January 2017 and the end of December 2017.
   Results
   Forty-eight new studies, describing the development of 56 COS, were included. There has been an increase in the number of studies clearly specifying the scope of the COS in terms of the population (n = 43, 90%) and intervention (n = 48, 100%) characteristics. Public participation has continued to rise with over half (n = 27, 56%) of studies in the current review including input from members of the public. The rate of inclusion of all stakeholder groups has increased, in particular participation from non-clinical research experts has risen from 32% (mean average in previous reviews) to 62% (n = 29). Input from participants located in Australasia (n = 17; 41%), Asia (n = 18; 44%), South America (n = 13; 32%) and Africa (n = 7; 17%) have all increased since the previous reviews.
   Conclusion
   This update included a pronounced increase in the number of new COS identified compared to the previous three updates. There was an improvement in the reporting of the scope, stakeholder participants and methods used. Furthermore, there has been an increase in participation from Australasia, Asia, South America and Africa. These advancements are reflective of the efforts made in recent years to raise awareness about the need for COS development and uptake, as well as developments in COS methodology.

TI Healthy human serum N-glycan profiling reveals the influence of ethnic

DT Article
ID SIALIC-ACID; QUANTITATIVE GLYCOMICS; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-G; GLYCOSYLATION;
   HYPERTENSION; ASSOCIATION; MECHANISMS; COMPLEXITY; BRAIN
AB Background
   Most glycomics studies have focused on understanding disease mechanisms and proposing serum markers for various diseases, yet the influence of ethnic variation on the identified glyco-biomarker remains poorly addressed. This study aimed to investigate the inter-ethnic serum N-glycan variation among US origin control, Japanese, Indian, and Ethiopian healthy volunteers.
   Methods
   Human serum from 54 healthy subjects of various ethnicity and 11 Japanese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were included in the study. We employed a comprehensive glycoblotting-assisted MALDI-TOF/MS-based quantitative analysis of serum N-glycome and fluorescence HPLC-based quantification of sialic acid species. Data representing serum N-glycan or sialic acid levels were compared among the ethnic groups using SPSS software.
   Results
   Total of 51 N-glycans released from whole serum glycoproteins could be reproducibly quantified within which 33 glycoforms were detected in all ethnicities. The remaining N-glycans were detected weakly but exclusively either in the Ethiopians (13 glycans) or in all the other ethnic groups (5 glycans). Highest abundance (p < 0.001) of high mannose, core-fucosylated, hyperbranched/hypersialylated N-glycans was demonstrated in Ethiopians. In contrast, only one glycan (m/z 2118) significantly differed among all ethnicities being highest in Indians and lowest in Ethiopians. Glycan abundance trend in Ethiopians was generally close to that of Japanese HCC patients. Glycotyping analysis further revealed ethnic-based disparities mainly in the branched and sialylated structures. Surprisingly, some of the glycoforms greatly elevated in the Ethiopian subjects have been identified as serum biomarkers of various cancers. Sialic acid level was significantly increased primarily in Ethiopians, compared to the other ethnicities.
   Conclusion
   The study revealed ethnic-specific differences in healthy human serum N-glycome with highest abundance of most glycoforms in the Ethiopian ethnicity. The results strongly emphasized the need to consider ethnicity matching for accurate glyco-biomarker identification. Further large-scale study employing various ethnic compositions is needed to verify the current result.

DT Article
ID REPORTING QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; MENTAL-HEALTH; REFUGEE WOMEN; MIGRATION;

AB Background
   Pregnant women and new mothers seeking asylum are subject to major challenges that may affect their health and increase their vulnerability. The study aim was to investigate asylum seeking women's experiences and perceived needs during pregnancy and early motherhood whilst living in state-provided accommodation in one federal state in Southern Germany, with a particular focus on psychosocial factors.
   Methods
   In this exploratory case study, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants in pregnancy and up to the six-week postnatal assessment. Two female interviewers performed interviews assisted by female professional interpreters. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. An inductive approach was taken to content analysis of interview material.
   Results
   21 interviews were performed with nine women seeking asylum in pregnancy and early motherhood. Women shared experiences and perceived consequences on their psychosocial health. The following five key themes were identified during content analysis: a) psychosocial stressors, b) stressful living circumstances, c) stressful relationships, d) social support and e) coping styles. Psychosocial factors were a significant source of mental stress for participants, especially due to future uncertainties linked with the asylum seeking process. Living circumstances were also marked by stressors including a lack of privacy, verbal and physical threats and experiences of powerlessness. Further strain and emotional pressure were caused by stressful relationships with the unborn child's father. Social support and personal coping styles provided relief for some participants.
   Conclusions
   This study provides in-depth insights into the experiences and perceived needs of pregnant asylum seekers and new mothers living in state-provided accommodation. Key results identified psychosocial factors such as future uncertainties, stressful living circumstances and stressful relationships, as social determinants of health that were perceived to adversely affect women's health. Adequate social support and individual coping styles increased resilience and counterbalanced psychosocial stressors during the asylum seeking process.

AB Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the world's most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection, and high-risk HPV types are strongly linked to cervical dysplasia and carcinoma. Puerto Ricans are among the US citizens with higher HPV prevalence and lower screening rates and access to treatment. This bleak statistic was as a motivation to detect biomarkers for early diagnosis of HPV in this population. We collected both urine and cervical swabs from 43 patients attending San Juan Clinics. Cervical swabs were used for genomic DNA extractions and HPV genotyping with the HPV SPF10-LiPA25 kit, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed on the urine-derived products for metabolomics analyses. We aimed at discriminating between patients with different HPV categories: HPV negative (HPV-), HPV positive with simultaneous low and high-risk infections (HPV+B) and HPV positive exclusively high-risk (HPV+H). We found that the metabolome of HPV+B is closer to HPV- than to HPV+H supporting evidence that suggests HPV co-infections may be antagonistic due to viral interference leading to a lower propensity for cervical cancer development. In contrast, metabolites of patients with HPV+H were significantly different from those that were HPV-. We identified three urinary metabolites 5-Oxoprolinate, Erythronic acid and N-Acetylaspartic acid that discriminate HPV+H cases from negative controls. These metabolites are known to be involved in a variety of biochemical processes related to energy and metabolism and may likely be biomarkers for HPV high-risk cervical infection. However, further validation should follow using a larger patient cohort and diverse populations to confirm our finding.

TI English verb regularization in books and tweets
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS
AB The English language has evolved dramatically throughout its lifespan, to the extent that a modern speaker of Old English would be incomprehensible without translation. One concrete indicator of this process is the movement from irregular to regular (-ed) forms for the past tense of verbs. In this study we quantify the extent of verb regularization using two vastly disparate datasets: (1) Six years of published books scanned by Google (2003-2008), and (2) A decade of social media messages posted to Twitter (2008-2017). We find that the extent of verb regularization is greater on Twitter, taken as a whole, than in English Fiction books. Regularization is also greater for tweets geotagged in the United States relative to American English books, but the opposite is true for tweets geotagged in the United Kingdom relative to British English books. We also find interesting regional variations in regularization across counties in the United States. However, once differences in population are accounted for, we do not identify strong correlations with socio-demographic variables such as education or income.

AB Intracellular delivery of DNA is considered a challenge in biological research and treatment of diseases. The previously reported transfection rate by commercially available transfection reagents in cancer cell lines, such as the mouse lung tumor cell line (TC-1), is very low. The purpose of this study is to introduce and optimize an efficient gene transfection method by mechanical approaches. The combinatory transfection effect of mechanical treatments and conventional chemical carriers is also investigated on a formerly reported hard-to-transfect cell line (TC-1). To study the effect of mechanical loadings on transfection rate, TC-1 tumor cells are subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch, equiaxial cyclic stretch, and shear stress. The TurboFect transfection reagent is exerted for chemical transfection purposes. The pEGFP-N1 vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression is utilized to determine gene delivery into the cells. The results show a significant DNA delivery rate (by similar to 30%) in mechanically transfected cells compared to the samples that were transfected with chemical carriers. Moreover, the simultaneous treatment of TC-1 tumor cells with chemical carriers and mechanical loadings significantly increases the gene transfection rate up to similar to 63% after 24 h post-transfection. Our results suggest that the simultaneous use of mechanical loading and chemical reagent can be a promising approach in delivering cargoes into cells with low transfection potentials and lead to efficient cancer treatments.

AB Background
   Prolonged angiogenesis inhibition may improve treatment outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. However, due to the complexity of the angiogenic pathways there is a lack of valid predictive biomarkers for anti-angiogenic agents. Here, we describe and optimize a procedure for simultaneous dynamic profiling of multiple angiogenesis related proteins in patient serum to explore associations with the response and acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.
   Materials and methods
   Patients (n=22) were selected from a clinical trial investigating maintenance treatment with bevacizumab alone after response to induction chemotherapy + bevacizumab in mCRC. Serum samples were analysed for 55 unique angiogenesis related proteins using a commercial proteome profiler array and a publicly available image analysis program for quantification. Samples were collected at baseline before induction treatment start, at start of maintenance treatment, and at end of treatment after tumour progression.
   Main results and conclusion
   For eight proteins, the antibody array signals were below detection range in all patient samples. None of the proteins showed levels at baseline or at start of maintenance with strong evidence for correlation to time to progression (lowest nominal p-value 0.03). The dynamic ranges of protein levels measured during the induction treatment period and during the maintenance period were analysed separately for time trends. Evidence for changing trends (up/down) in the levels of MMP-8, TIMP-4 and EGF was observed both during response to induction treatment and at progressive disease, respectively. For three of the proteins (IL-8, Activin A and IGFBP-2), weak evidence for correlation between increasing protein levels during induction with chemotherapy and bevacizumab and time to progression was observed.
   In conclusion, semi-quantitative profiling of angiogenesis related proteins in patient serum may be a versatile tool to screen for protein patterns aiming at identifying resistance mechanisms of anti-angiogenic treatment in patients with mCRC.

TI Examination of viraemia and clinical signs after challenge with a

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME VIRUS; IMPACT; POPULATION
AB Vaccination with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) Type 2 modified-live vaccines (MLVs) has been shown to improve clinical signs and survival rates in PRRS virus (PRRSV)-challenged pigs. This study evaluated the dose of PRRSV challenge needed to cause and maintain viraemia in PRRS Type 2 MLV-vaccinated pigs and assessed clinical responses to various doses of virulent challenge. This controlled, randomised, blinded vaccination-challenge study involved 95 pigs who were either vaccinated with 2 mL of a PRRS Type 2 MLV on Day 0 or left unvaccinated. On Day 28, pigs were challenged intranasally with virulent PRRSV isolate (dose range <1.5 to 4 log(10) 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL). Five pigs were left unchallenged and served as environmental controls. Viraemia levels, pyrexia, average daily weight gain and clinical signs were assessed. At all challenge doses, vaccinated groups had reduced viraemia levels and clinical signs, and higher average daily weight gain compared with non-vaccinated groups. Vaccinated groups challenged with <= 2 log had similar viraemia levels and clinical performance (days pyrexic and average daily weight gain) as the non-challenged group. Vaccinated groups had significantly reduced pyrexic days compared with non-vaccinated groups across all challenge doses (P <. 05). Vaccinated pigs challenged with <3 log had significantly improved average daily weight gain (P <. 05). In vaccinated groups, challenge dose correlated positively with viraemia levels and number of days pyrexic, and negatively with average daily weight gain. This is the first study to use a challenge-dose model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination against PRRSV. PRRS Type 2 MLV was shown to mitigate the consequences of PRRSV infection at all evaluated PRRSV challenge doses. Lower levels of challenge had minimal impact on health and performance of vaccinated pigs, supporting the benefit of vaccinating swine with PRRS Type 2 MLV.

   SELECTION; ASSAY; MILK
AB The most commonly used method for measuring carotenoid concentration is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Nevertheless, easier, quicker, and less costly proxy methods exist. We aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of several proxy methods: the spectrophotometer, iCheck Carotene, and near-infrared spectroscopy using both a desktop (dNIRS) and a portable (pNIRS) device for the measurement of total carotenoid concentration (TCC) and all-trans-beta-carotene concentration (trans-BC) in 30 fresh cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) storage roots in comparison with HPLC. The spectrophotometer presented the highest predictability for TCC, followed by iCheck, dNIRS, and pNIRS. The dNIRS showed the highest predictability and agreement for trans-BC. The pNIRS showed the poorest repeatability and greatest underestimations compared with HPLC. The agreement between all methods was lower for higher carotenoid concentration, with the exception of the spectrophotometer. According to our results, and for screening purposes, the measurement of carotenoids in fresh cassava roots can be carried out by spectrophotometer, iCheck Carotene and NIRS methods depending on the availability of equipment.

AB Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis (Ca. N. mikurensis; family Anaplasmataceae) is an emerging tick-borne pathogen that causes a systemic inflammatory syndrome with thrombotic complications. We report here the first identification of Ca. N. mikurensis in organ samples from small mammals captured in southwest South Korea. Nested PCR of groEL and 16S rRNA genes was used to confirm the identity of the bacteria present, and successfully amplified fragments were sequenced. All captured animals were identified as striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius), approximately 28.6% (4/14) and 21.4% (3/14) of which were found to be PCR-positive for Ca. N. mikurensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, respectively. The detection of Ca. N. mikurensis in these animals represents the first evidence of this pathogen in South Korea. Carriage of this bacterium by rodents highlights the need for more detailed investigation of their role in its transmission to humans.

AB Salicylic acid (SA) is responsible for certain plant defence responses and NON EXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1 (NPR1) is the master regulator of SA perception. In Arabidopsis thaliana there are five paralogs of NPR1. In this work we tested the role of these paralogs in SA perception by generating combinations of mutants and transgenics. NPR2 was the only paralog able to partially complement an npr1 mutant. The null npr2 reduces SA perception in combination with npr1 or other paralogs. NPR2 and NPR1 interacted in all the conditions tested, and NPR2 also interacted with other SA-related proteins as NPR1 does. The remaining paralogs behaved differently in SA perception, depending on the genetic background, and the expression of some of the genes induced by SA in an npr1 background was affected by the presence of the paralogs. NPR2 fits all the requirements of an SA receptor while the remaining paralogs also work as SA receptors with a strong hierarchy. According to the data presented here, the closer the gene is to NPR1, the more relevant its role in SA perception.

AB Herd protection, resulting from the interruption of transmission and asymptomatic carriage, is an important element of the effectiveness of vaccines against the meningococcus. Whilst this has been well established for conjugate polysaccharide vaccines directed against the meningococcal capsule, two uncertainties surround the potential herd protection provided by the novel protein-based vaccines that are used in place of serogroup B (MenB) polysaccharide vaccines (i) the strain coverage of such vaccines against carried meningococci, which are highly diverse; and (ii) the generation of a protective immune response in the mucosa. These considerations are essential for realistic estimates of cost-effectiveness of new MenB vaccines. Here the first of these questions is addressed by the whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of meningococci isolated from healthy military recruits and university students in Greece. The study included a total of 71 MenB isolates obtained from 1420 oropharyngeal single swab samples collected from military recruits and university students on voluntary basis, aged 18-26 years. In addition to WGS analysis to identify genetic lineage and vaccine antigen genes, including the Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type (BAST), the isolates were examined with the serological Meningococcal antigen Typing System (MATS) assay. Comparison of these data demonstrated that the carried meningococcal population was highly diverse with 38% of the carriage isolates showed expression of antigens matching those included in the 4CMenB vaccine. Our data may suggest a limited potential herd immunity to be expected and be driven by an impact on a subset of carriage isolates.

DT Article
ID VAGUS NERVE; HYPERVENTILATION; FATIGUE
AB The diaphragm is well known for its role as the principal muscle of respiration. However, according to previous studies, its role is multifactorial, from breathing through pain perception, regulation of emotional sphere, collaborating in gastroesophageal functions, facilitating the venous and lymphatic return, to an essential role in the maintenance of lumbar spine stability. The purpose of the study was to examine whether diaphragm function parameters (thickness and range of motion) are associated with static balance maintenance. A total of 142 participants were examined and divided into three groups: G1-patients qualified for lung resection due to cancer; G2-patients after lobe resection; G3-healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickness and excursion was measured using ultrasonography. Stabilometric parameters of balance were assessed by Zebris FDM-S platform. Greater diaphragm thickening during active breathing and diaphragm thickness fraction were associated with better static balance parameters. Limitation of diaphragm motion during quiet breathing and deep breathing was linked to balance disorders. There was no correlation between diaphragm muscle excursion during sniff maneuvers and balance parameters. Deterioration of diaphragm function observed after thoracic surgery was closely related with deterioration of balance maintenance. Impairment of diaphragm function manifested by decrease of muscle thickness and movement restriction is strongly associated with balance disorders in a clinical sample and among healthy subjects.

TI Assessing the sensitivity of the polio environmental surveillance system

AB Background
   The polio environmental surveillance (ES) system has been an incredible tool for advancing polio eradication efforts because of its ability to highlight the spatial and temporal extent of poliovirus circulation. While ES often outperforms, or is more sensitive than AFP surveillance, the sensitivity of the ES system has not been well characterized. Fundamental uncertainty of ES site sensitivity makes it difficult to interpret results from ES, particularly negative results.
   Methods and findings
   To study ES sensitivity, we used data from Afghanistan and Pakistan to examine the probability that each ES site detected the Sabin 1, 2, or 3 components of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) as a function of virus prevalence within the same district (estimated from AFP data). Accounting for virus prevalence is essential for estimating site sensitivity because Sabin detection rates should vary with prevalence-high immediately after supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), but low in subsequent months. We found that most ES sites in Pakistan and Afghanistan are highly sensitive for detecting poliovirus relative to AFP surveillance in the same districts. For example, even when Sabin poliovirus is at low prevalence of similar to 0.5-3% in AFP surveillance, most ES sites have similar to 34-50% probability of detecting Sabin. However, there was considerable variation in ES site sensitivity and we flagged several sites for re-evaluation based on low sensitivity rankings and low wild polio virus detection rates. In these areas, adding new sites or modifying collection methods in current sites could improve sensitivity of environmental surveillance.
   Conclusions
   Relating ES detections to virus prevalence significantly improved our ability to evaluate site sensitivity compared to evaluations based solely on ES detection rates. To extend our approach to new sites and regions, we provide a preliminary framework for relating ES and AFP detection rates, and descriptions of how detection rates might relate to SIAs and natural seasonality.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) involve in the epigenetic regulation and its major mechanism is the sequestration of the target micro RNAs (miRNAs). We hypothesized that circRNAs might be related with the pathophysiology of chronic epilepsy and evaluated the altered circRNA expressions and their possible regulatory effects on their target miRNAs and mRNAs in a mouse epilepsy model. The circRNA expression profile in the hippocampus of the pilocarpine mice was analyzed and compared with control. The correlation between the expression of miRNA binding sites (miRNA response elements, MRE) in the dysregulated circRNAs and the expression of their target miRNAs was evaluated. As miRNAs also inhibit their target mRNAs, circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, comprised of dysregulated RNAs that targets one another were searched. For the identified networks, bioinformatics analyses were performed. As the result, Forty-three circRNAs were dysregulated in the hippocampus (up-regulated, 26; down-regulated, 17). The change in the expression of MRE in those circRNAs negatively correlated with the change in the relevant target miRNA expression (r = -0.461, P< 0.001), supporting that circRNAs inhibit their target miRNA. 333 dysregulated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were identified. Gene ontology and pathway analyses demonstrated that the up-regulated mRNAs in those networks were closely related to the major processes in epilepsy. Among them, STRING analysis identified 37 key mRNAs with abundant (>= 4) interactions with other dysregulated target mRNAs. The dysregulation of the circRNAs which had multiple interactions with key mRNAs were validated by PCR. We concluded that dysregulated circRNAs might have a pathophysiologic role in chronic epilepsy by regulating multiple disease relevant mRNAs via circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions.

TI SLC3A2 is a novel endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signaling protein

AB Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress results from imbalances in unfolded/misfolded proteins, contributing to a wide variety of human diseases. To better understand the mechanisms involved in the cellular response to ER stress in cardiomyocytes, we previously conducted a genome-wide screening in an in vitro ER stress model of rat cardiomyocytes, which highlighted amino acid transporter heavy chain, member 2 (SLC3A2) as an important factor in ER stress. In the present study, we characterized the role of SLC3A2 during the unfolded protein response (UPR), as one of the primary pathways activated during ER stress. First, we confirmed the induction of Slc3a2 mRNA expression following treatment with various ER stress inducers in rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) and neural cells (PC12). Knockdown of Slc3a2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) revealed that the encoded protein functions upstream of three important UPR proteins: ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of both SLC3A2 and mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTOR1) revealed that mTOR1 acts as a mediator between SLC3A2 and the UPR. RNA sequencing was then performed to gain a more thorough understanding of the function of SLC3A2, which identified 23 highly differentially regulated genes between the control and knockdown cell lines, which were related to the UPR and amino acid transport. Notably, flow cytometry further showed that SLC3A2 inhibition also enhanced the apoptosis of rat cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these results highlight SLC3A2 as a complex, multifunctional signaling protein that acts upstream of well-known UPR proteins with anti-apoptotic properties, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ER stress-related diseases.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID GII.17 NOROVIRUS; EMERGENCE; VICTORIA; SEQUENCE; STRAINS; WATER
AB Noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. From June 2015 to March 2017, fifteen outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were reported to the Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. To identify the circulating NoV genotypes associated with outbreaks in Jinan, China, 414 specimens from the 15 outbreaks were collected and analyzed for the causative viruses, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the NoV-positive strains. The NoV detection rate was 57.5% (238/414), and a total of 14 outbreaks were caused by NoVs (eight by infection with genogroup II (GII), five by mixed infection with GI and GII, and one by mixed infection with GII and rotavirus (RoV)-A). A total of 75 NoV sequences were obtained from 13 NoV-positive outbreaks and classified into seven genotypes (38 GII.17, 13 GII.2, 4 GII.3, 4 GII.1, 10 GI.6, 5 GI.5 and 1 GI.3), while GII.4 was not identified. The most prevalent genotype changed yearly during the 2015-2017 period. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these NoV genotypes had high homology with the strains circulating worldwide, especially strains from Asian countries and cities. Our study illustrated that multiple non-GII.4 NoV genotypes were prevalent in outbreaks of AGE in Jinan, China. Year-round surveillance of multiple NoV genotypes could help health authorities reduce the impact of NoV outbreaks on public health.

TI HIV incidence among pregnant and postpartum women in a high prevalence

DT Article
ID INFECTION; AGE
AB In sub-Saharan Africa, most women who test HIV negative at the first antenatal care encounter are rarely tested again during pregnancy and postpartum, yet data suggests that pregnancy is associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition compared to non-pregnant women. We describe HIV incidence during pregnancy and postpartum in Lesotho, a high prevalence setting, and factors associated with HIV seroconversion. We enrolled a cohort of HIV negative women presenting at health facilities for antenatal care and followed them through delivery up to 24 months postpartum. Women were repeatedly tested for HIV according to the Lesotho Ministry of Health routine rapid HIV testing guidelines and responded to risk behavior questionnaire every three months. We estimated HIV incidence and associated 95% confidence intervals. We used mixed effects Cox regression models to identify independent factors associated with seroconversion accounting for repeated assessment. The estimated overall HIV incidence rate was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.05-2.28) per 100 person-years. The estimated HIV incidence rate during pregnancy (2.61 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 1.12-5.14) was almost double the estimated HIV incidence during postpartum (1.36 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 0.83-2.10). Women's age (14-24 years compared to 25-45 years), multiple sexual partnerships, urethral discharge and no condoms nor pre-exposure prophylaxis were independently associated with HIV infection. There is an increased need for counseling and support of HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women to stay HIV-negative, including provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis during this high-risk period, particularly among adolescent and young women.

TI Knowledge on birth preparedness and complication readiness among
   expecting couples in rural Tanzania: Differences by sex cross-sectional
   study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; MORTALITY
AB Background
   Inadequate knowledge of birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) among expecting couples delays timely access to maternal emergency services. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge on birth preparedness and complication readiness and how men and women differ" among expecting couples in a rural setting of Rukwa Region, Tanzania.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study targeting pregnant women and their partners was performed from June 2017 to October 2017. A total of 546 couples were sampled using three-stage probability sampling techniques and then interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The mean score difference was sought using independent t-test. Multiple linear regressions were performed to determine the predictors of knowledge.
   Results
   There was a significant difference in mean knowledge scores between pregnant women (M = 5.58, SD = 4.591) and male partners (M = 4.37, SD = 4.285); t (1085) = -4.525; p<0.001. Among women, BPCR levels were positively influenced by age (beta = 0.236; p<0.01), having ever heard about birth preparedness (beta = 0.176; p<0.001), being of Mambwe ethnicity (beta = 0.187; p<0.001), living near a health center rather than a dispensary (beta = 0.101; p<0.05) and having had a prior preterm delivery (beta = 0.086; p<0.05). Access to media through radio ownership negatively influenced BPCR levels among both women (beta-.119; p<0.01) and men (beta = -0.168; p<0.0001). Among men, the BPCR knowledge was only positively influenced by having ever heard about birth preparedness (beta = 0.169; p<0.001), age at marriage (beta = -0.103; p<0.05), and having completed either primary (beta = 0.157; p<0.001) or secondary education (beta = 0.131; p<0.01).
   Conclusion
   Some important predictors of knowledge were revealed among women and men, but overall knowledge about birth preparedness and complication readiness was low. This study demonstrates inadequate knowledge and understanding at the community level about key elements of birth preparedness and complication readiness. In order to improve access to life-saving care for women and neonates, there is a pressing need for innovative community strategies to increase knowledge about birth preparedness and complication readiness. Such strategies are essential in order to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in rural Tanzania.

TI The short-term efficacy and safety of artificial total disc replacement
   for selected patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease compared
   with anterior lumbar interbody fusion: A systematic review and
   meta-analysis

AB Purpose
   To systematically compare the efficacy and safety of lumbar total disc replacement (TDR) with the efficacy and safety of anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease (LDDD).
   Methods
   The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for the period from the establishment of the databases to March 2018. The peer-reviewed articles that investigate the safety and efficacy of TDR and ALIF were retrieved under the given search terms. Quality assessment must be done independently by two authors according to each item of criterion. The statistical analyses were performed using RevMan (version 5.3) and Stata (version 14.0). The random-effect model was carried out to pool the data. The I-2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of the results of meta-analyses by omitting the articles one by one.
   Results
   Six studies (5 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 1 observational study) involving 1093 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The risk of bias of the studies could be considered as low to moderate. Operative time (MD = 4.95; 95% CI - 18.91-28.81; P = 0.68), intraoperative blood loss (MD = 4.95; 95% CI - 18.91-28.81; P = 0.68), hospital stay (MD = -0.33; 95% CI, - 0.67-0.01; P = 0.05), complications (RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.91-1.02; P = 0.18) and re-operation rate (RR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.14-2.12; P = 0.38) were without significant clinical difference between groups. Patients in the TDR group had higher postoperative satisfaction (RR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.07-1.32; P = 0.001) and, better improvements in ODI (MD = -10.99; 95% CI -21.50- -0.48; P = 0.04), VAS (MD = -10.56; 95% CI -19.99- -1.13; P = 0.03) and postoperative lumbar mobility than did patients in the ALIF group.
   Conclusions
   The results showed that TDR has significant superiority in term of reduced clinical symptoms, improved physical function and preserved range of motion for the treatment of LDDD compared to ALIF. TDR may be an ideal alternative for the selected patients with LDDD in the short-term. However, the results of this study cannot suggest the use of TDR instead of ALIF in lumbar spine treatment only in the light of short term results. More studies that are well-designed, that are of high-quality and that have larger samples are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of TDR with at the long-term follow-up.

AB The plant NAC transcription factors depict one of the largest plant transcription factor families. They regulate a wide range of different developmental processes and most probably played an important role in the evolutionary diversification of plants. This makes comparative studies of the NAC transcription factor family between individual species and genera highly relevant and such studies have in recent years been greatly facilitated by the increasing number of fully sequenced complex plant genomes. This study combines the characterization of the NAC transcription factors in the recently sequenced genome of the cereal crop barley with expression analysis and a comprehensive phylogenetic characterization of the NAC transcription factors in other monocotyledonous plant species. Our results provide evidence for the emergence of a NAC transcription factor subclade that is exclusively expressed in the grains of the Poaceae family of grasses. These notably comprise a number of cereal crops other than barley, such as wheat, rice, maize or millet, which are all cultivated for their starchy edible grains. Apparently, the grain specific subclade emerged from a well described subgroup of NAC transcription factors associated with the senescence process. A promoter exchange subsequently resulted in grain specific expression. We propose to designate this transcription factor subclade Grain-NACs and we discuss their involvement in programmed cell death as well as their potential role in the evolution of the Poaceae grain, which doubtlessly is of central importance for human nutrition.

AB Semaphorins are a diverse family of immunoregulators recently recognized to play a major role in various phases of immune responses. Their role in chronic viral hepatitis C (CHC) and contribution to the progression of liver disease is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of secreted semaphorins with the severity of liver disease in patients with CHC. Serum concentrations of semaphorins were measured in 114 treatment-naive CHC patients and 36 healthy controls. Serum concentrations of SEMA3A, SEMA3C, SEMA5A, SEMA6B and SEMA6D were significantly increased in patients with CHC compared to controls. While serum concentrations of SEMA3C and SEMA6D significantly increased with fibrosis stage in both HCV-g1 and HCV-g3 infections, the concentration of SEMA5A inversely correlated with fibrosis stage in both HCV genotypes. ROC analysis showed that serum concentrations of SEMA3C (>4.0ng/mL, AUC 0.88) and SEMA6D (>4.5, AUC 0.82) had higher AUC than widely used APRI (AUC 0.71) and FIB-4 (AUC 0.74) scores. Serum concentrations of SEMA3C and SEMA6D significantly decreased after DAA and PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy, while the serum concentration of SEMA5A significantly increased after DAAs therapy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of SEMA3C and SEMA5A in hepatocytes, endothelial cells and lymphocytes of cirrhotic livers from CHC patients but not in controls. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that SEMA3C, SEMA5A and SEMA6D can be considered as markers of liver injury in CHC.

AB Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). PrEP uptake and adherence remain low and product preferences are unknown, especially among young African American MSM who are most at-risk. We conducted 26 qualitative interviews from 2014-2016 among young adult HIV-negative African American MSM regarding PrEP product preferences in Missouri. While the pill and injectable were most liked of all modalities, about a quarter preferred rectal products or patches. Most participants preferred a long-acting injectable (LAI) to daily oral pills due to better medication adherence and a dislike for taking pills. Many participants preferred daily oral pills to on-demand oral PrEP due to the inability to predict sex and the perception that insufficient time or medication would not achieve HIV protection with on-demand. A fear of needles and the perception that there would not be therapeutic levels for a long duration were concerns with injectable PrEP. Study findings highlight the need for a range of prevention options for African American MSM and can inform PrEP product development as well as dissemination and implementation efforts.

AB Background
   Mathematical models are useful tools to predict fluid shifts between body compartments in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The ability of a model to accurately describe the transport of water between cells and interstitium (J(v,ISIC)), and the consequent changes in intracellular volume (ICV), is important for a complete assessment of fluid distribution and plasma refilling. In this study, we propose a model describing transport of fluid in the three main body compartments (intracellular, interstitial and vascular), complemented by transport mechanisms for proteins and small solutes.
   Methods
   The model was applied to data from 23 patients who underwent standard HD. The substances described in the baseline model were: water, proteins, Na, K, and urea. Small solutes were described with two-compartment kinetics between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Solute transport across the cell membrane took place via passive diffusion and, for Na and K, through the ATPase pump, characterized by the maximum transport rate, Jp(MAX). From the data we estimated Jp(MAX) and two other parameters linked to transcapillary transport of fluid and protein: the capillary filtration coefficient Lp and its large pores fraction a LP. In an Expanded model one more generic solute was included to evaluate the impact of the number of substances appearing in the equation describing J(v,ISIC).
   Results
   In the baseline model, median values (interquartile range) of estimated parameters were: Lp: 11.63 (7.9, 14.2) mL/min/mmHg, alpha(LP): 0.056 (0.050, 0.058), and Jp(MAX): 5.52 (3.75, 7.54) mmol/min. These values were significantly different from those obtained by the Expanded model: Lp: 8.14 (6.29, 10.01) mL/min/mmHg, alpha(LP): 0.046 (0.038, 0.052), and Jp(MAX): 16.7 11.9, 25.2) mmol/min. The relative RMSE (root mean squared error) averaged between all simulated quantities compared to data was 3.9 (3.1, 5.6) %.
   Conclusions
   The model was able to accurately reproduce most of the changes observed in HD by tuning only three parameters. While the drop in ICV was overestimated by the model, the difference between simulations and data was less than the measurement error. The biggest change in the estimated parameters in the Expanded model was a marked increase of Jp(MAX) indicating that this parameter is highly sensitive to the number of species modeled, and that the value of Jp(MAX) should be interpreted only in relation to this factor.

AB Despite extensive evidence relating attachment dimensions to maladaptive interpersonal behaviours and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, few studies have explored social anxiety in the context of adult attachment dimensions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether attachment-related anxiety and avoidance are associated with symptoms of social anxiety and whether cognitive emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal and suppression) play a role in the relationship between adult attachment and social anxiety. A sample of 253 adults (male n = 47, 18.6%; female n = 202, 79.8%; gender not disclosed n = 4, 1.6%) ranging in age from 18 to 74 years (M = 33.12, SD = 11.56) completed an online questionnaire that consisted of the Experience in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire (ECR-R); The Inventory of Interpersonal Situations Discomfort scale (IIS-D); and The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Results indicated that both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have a direct effect on indices of social anxiety symptomology. Reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and social anxiety. However, the relationship between attachment avoidance and social anxiety was not mediated by the use of reappraisal and suppression. Findings of the study have implications for the development of clinical interventions targeting mediators of psychological distress associated with social anxiety.

TI Impact of mydriasis in fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTOFLUORESCENCE; FUNDUS
AB Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) is a novel technique that measures in vivo autofluorescence intensity decay over time of endogenous fluorophores in the retina. The Heidelberg Engineering FLIO system was used to obtain two 30 degree scans centered on the fovea of both eyes. The FLIO system uses a 473nm blue scanning laser light source and the emitted fluorescence is detected in two wavelengths channels, short and long spectral channels (SSC, LSC). Since the mydriatic status influence the FLIO result, the impact of mydriasis on FLIO need to be clarified. In this prospective, observational study, the impact of mydriasis on measurements from fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscope (FLIO) images in normal subjects were evaluated. 12 healthy participants (24 eyes) were volunteered and all subjects were scanned twice and the mean fluorescence lifetime (tau(m)) values were computed with dilation and without dilation on different days. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated from the measured tau(m) in dilated, nondilated and between the dilated and non-dilated setting. Test duration was also compared and correlated with lifetimes in both settings. Repeatability was excellent for both the dilation and non-dilation settings (ICC; 0.967-0.996; 0.926-0.986, respectively). The agreement between the dilation and non-dilation settings, however, were lower (ICC; 0.688-0.970). The tau(m) in the non-dilation setting was significantly longer than in the dilation setting for the SSC (P<0.05). The FLIO test duration in the non-dilation setting was significantly longer than with dilation for the SSC (P<0.05). Although good repeatability in tau(m) measurements between imaging sessions were observed both with and without dilation, the agreement was not as good when comparing dilated with non-dilated measurements. Since FLIO without mydriasis results in longer tau(m) in the SSC and takes a longer time for image acquisition, maximal dilation is recommended for FLIO testing.

AB Modulating the complement system is a promising strategy in drug discovery for disorders with uncontrolled complement activation. Although some of these disorders can be effectively treated with an antibody that inhibits complement C5, the high plasma concentration of C5 requires a huge dosage and frequent intravenous administration. Moreover, a conventional anti-C5 antibody can cause C5 to accumulate in plasma by reducing C5 clearance when C5 forms an immune complex (IC) with the antibody, which can be salvaged from endosomal vesicles by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling. In order to neutralize the increased C5, an even higher dosage of the antibody would be required. This antigen accumulation can be suppressed by giving the antibody a pH-dependent C5-binding property so that C5 is released from the antibody in the acidic endosome and then trafficked to the lysosome for degradation, while the C5-free antibody returns back to plasma. We recently demonstrated that a pH-dependent C5-binding antibody, SKY59, exhibited long-lasting neutralization of C5 in cynomolgus monkeys, showing potential for subcutaneous delivery or less frequent administration. Here we report the details of the antibody engineering involved in generating SKY59, from humanizing a rabbit antibody to improving the C5-binding property. Moreover, because the pH-dependent C5-binding antibodies that we first generated still accumulated C5, we hypothesized that the surface charges of the ICs partially contributed to a slow uptake rate of the C5-antibody ICs. This idea motivated us to engineer the surface charges of the antibody. Our surface-charge engineered antibody consequently exhibited a high capacity to sweep C5 and suppressed the C5 accumulation in vivo by accelerating the cycle of sweeping: uptake of ICs into cells, release of C5 from the antibody in endosomes, and salvage of the antigen-free antibody. Thus, our engineered anti-C5 antibody, SKY59, is expected to provide significant benefits for patients with complement-mediated disorders.

TI Treatment with P28GST, a schistosome-derived enzyme, after acute colitis
   induction in mice: Decrease of intestinal inflammation associated with a
   down regulation of Th1/Th17 responses

AB Background
   P28GST, a 28Kd glutathione S-transferase enzymatic protein derived from a schistosome helminth prevents experimental colitis when administered subcutaneously in the presence of adjuvant by decreasing pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 response. Given the antioxidant properties of P28GST, we evaluated its anti-inflammatory potential when administered locally after colitis induction in the absence of adjuvant.
   Methods
   Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by rectal administration of TNBS, followed by two intraperitoneal injections of P28GST at day 1 and day 2. Mice were sacrificed 48h after TNBS administration and evaluated for macroscopic and histological scores, myeloperoxidase (MPO) quantification and cytokine messenger RNA expression in the colonic tissues.
   Results
   Both clinical and histological scores significantly decreased in mice treated with P28GST at 5 or 50 mu g/kg when compared to vehicle-treated mice. A significant reduction of MPO was detected in colonic tissues from P28GST-treated mice, similarly to mice treated with methylprednisolone as the reference treatment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, mRNA as well as serum levels were down-regulated in mice colonic tissues treated with P28GST at 5 or 50 mu g/kg. In addition, a significant decrease of mRNA expression levels of T-bet, and ROR-Y, respective markers of Th1 and Th17 cells was observed. Whereas no significant effect was detected on Gata3 mRNA, a marker of Th2 cells, the Arg/iNOS mRNA levels significantly increased in P28GST-treated mice, suggesting the induction of M2 macrophages.
   Conclusions
   These findings provide evidence that P28GST injected locally after colitis induction induces a potent decrease of colitis inflammation in mice, associated to downregulation of Th1/Th17 response, and induction of anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages.

AB We provide the first detailed identification of Barents Sea cold seep frenulate hosts and their symbionts. Mitochondrial COI sequence analysis, in combination with detailed morphological investigations through both light and electron microscopy was used for identifying frenulate hosts, and comparing them to Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis and Oligobrachia webbi, two morphologically similar species known from the Norwegian Sea. Specimens from sites previously assumed to host O. haakonmosbiensis were included in our molecular analysis, which allowed us to provide new insight on the debate regarding species identity of these Oligobrachia worms. Our results indicate that high Arctic seeps are inhabited by a species that though closely related to Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis, is nonetheless distinct. We refer to this group as the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade, based on the colloquial names of the sites they are currently known to inhabit. Since members of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade cannot be distinguished from O. haakonmosbiensis or O. webbi based on morphology, we suggest that a complex of cryptic Oligobrachia species inhabit seeps in the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic. The symbionts of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade were also found to be closely related to O. haakonmosbiensis symbionts, but genetically distinct. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and transmission electron micrographs revealed extremely dense populations of bacteria within the trophosome of members of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade, which is unusual for frenulates. Bacterial genes for sulfur oxidation were detected and small rod shaped bacteria (round in cross section), typical of siboglinid-associated sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, were seen on electron micrographs of trophosome bacteriocytes, suggesting that sulfide constitutes the main energy source. We hypothesize that specific, local geochemical conditions, in particular, high sulfide fluxes and concentrations could account for the unusually high symbiont densities in members of the Oligrobrachia sp. CPL-clade.

AB Objectives Adults born preterm at very low birthweight (VLBW; <1500 g) have a non-optimal cardiometabolic risk factor profile. Since higher protein intake during the first weeks of life predicted a healthier body composition in adulthood in our previous studies, we hypothesized that it would also predict a favorable cardiometabolic profile.
   Study design
   The Helsinki Study of VLBW Adults includes 166 VLBW and preterm infants born between 1978 and 1985. We collected postnatal nutrition data among 125 unimpaired subjects, who attended two study visits at the mean ages of 22.5 and 25.1 years. We evaluated the effects of energy and macronutrient intakes during the first three 3-week periods of life on key cardiometabolic risk factors with multiple linear regression models. We also report results adjusted for prenatal, postnatal and adult characteristics.
   Results
   Macronutrient and energy intakes were not associated with blood pressure, heart rate, or lipid levels in adulthood. Intakes were neither associated with fasting glucose or most other markers of glucose metabolism. An exception was that the first-three-weeks-of-life intakes predicted higher fasting insulin levels: 1 g/kg/day higher protein intake by 37.6% (95% CI: 8.0%, 75.2%), and 10 kcal/kg/day higher energy intake by 8.6% (2.6%, 14.9%), when adjusted for sex and age. These early intakes similarly predicted the adult homeostasis model assessment index. Further adjustments strengthened these findings.
   Conclusions
   Among VLBW infants with relatively low early energy intake, early macronutrient and energy intakes were unrelated to blood pressure, lipid levels and intravenous glucose tolerance test results. Contrary to our hypothesis, a higher macronutrient intake during the first three weeks of life predicted higher fasting insulin concentration in young adulthood.

AB Kawasaki disease (KD), first identified in 1967, is a pediatric vasculitis of unknown etiology that has an increasing incidence in Japan and many other countries. KD can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Its epidemiological characteristics, such as seasonality and clinical picture of acute systemic inflammation with prodromal intestinal/respiratory symptoms, suggest an infectious etiology for KD. Interestingly, multiple host genotypes have been identified as predisposing factors for KD. To explore experimental methodology for identifying etiological agent(s) for KD and to optimize epidemiological study design (particularly the sample size) for future studies, we conducted a pilot study. For a 1-year period, we prospectively enrolled 11 patients with KD. To each KD patient, we assigned two control individuals (one with diarrhea and the other with respiratory infections), matched for age, sex, and season of diagnosis. During the acute phase of disease, we collected peripheral blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and feces. We also determined genotypes, to identify those that confer susceptibility to KD. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the risk genotypes between KD patients and control subjects. We also used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to analyze these samples. Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 (TTV7) in two patients with KD (18%), but not in control subjects (P = 0.111). Sanger sequencing revealed that the TTV7 found in the two KD patients contained almost identical variants in nucleotide and identical changes in resulting amino acid, relative to the reference sequence. Additionally, we estimated the sample size that would be required to demonstrate a statistical correlation between TTV7 and KD. Future larger scale studies with carefully optimized metagenomic sequencing experiments and adequate sample size are warranted to further examine the association between KD and potential pathogens, including TTV7.

TI Detection and initial management of gestational diabetes through primary
   health care services in Morocco: An effectiveness-implementation trial
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID WEIGHT-GAIN; PREGNANCY; HYPERGLYCEMIA; MELLITUS; PREVALENCE; DIAGNOSIS;
   RISK
AB Background
   Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) testing and management in Morocco is associated with delays resulting in late commencement of treatment. To reduce delays and to increase access of women to GDM care, a country-adapted intervention targeting primary health care providers was designed to test the hypothesis that detection and initial management of GDM at the primary level of care improves newborn outcomes in terms of lower birthweights and less cases of macrosomia and impacts on maternal weight gain, glucose balance and pregnancy outcomes.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in two districts of Morocco. In each district, 10 health centers were randomly selected to serve either as intervention or control sites. Pregnant women attending antenatal care in the study facilities were eligible to participate. At the intervention sites, women were offered GDM screening by capillary glucose testing following International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups/WHO criteria. Women diagnosed with GDM received counselling on nutrition and exercise and were followed up through their health center whereas at control facilities routine practice was applied. Primary outcome was birthweight and secondary outcomes maternal weight gain, glucose control and pregnancy complications. We further assessed GDM prevalence in the intervention arm. Statistical analysis was performed on 210 recruited women. Continuous variables were reported using means while categorical variables using frequencies with tests of independence applying chi-squared tests. Differences of outcome variables between the two groups were estimated by mixed-effects regression models and effect sizes adjusted for confounders. The trial is registered under NCT02979756 at ClinicalTrials.gov.
   Results
   GDM prevalence reached 23.7% in Marrakech. Birthweight in the intervention group was 147grams lower than in the control group (p = 0.08) as was the proportion of macrosomes (3.5% versus 18.4%; p<0.001). In the intervention arm, women did two times more follow-ups than at control sites (p = 0.001) and mean follow-up intervals were shorter (11.3 days versus 18.7 days; p < 0.001). Overall, 30% more fasting blood sugar values were balanced (p = 0.005) and mean weekly maternal weight gain 49 grams lower (p = 0.032) in the intervention group. More women from control facilities had a delivery complication whereas more newborn complications were observed in women from intervention facilities. No difference between the two groups existed regarding mode of delivery and mean gestational age at delivery. One of the main limitations of the study was the Hawthorn-effect at control sites that might have led to an underestimation of the effect size.
   Conclusion
   A high GDM prevalence in Morocco calls for a context-adapted screening and management approach to enable early interventions. GDM detection and care through antenatal care at primary health facilities may have positively impacted on newborn birthweight but findings are inconclusive. Results of this study will contribute to the decision on a potential upscaling of the intervention in Morocco. Future research could examine long term metabolic changes including diabetes type 2 in the cohort of women and their children.

TI Early childhood obesity prevention efforts through a life course health

SO PLOS ONE

   OVERWEIGHT PREVENTION; INTERVENTION; CHILDREN; PROGRAM; POLICY; OUTCOMES
AB Introduction
   The obesity rate in preschool children in the United States (US) is 13.9%, while even higher rates are associated with racial and ethnic minorities and children from low-income families. These prevalence patterns underscore the need to identify effective childhood obesity prevention programs.
   Method
   A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's framework to provide an overview of the types, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions and policies in children up to 6 years old. Inclusion criteria were studies at least 6-months duration; included a weight-based outcome, conducted in the US, English publications from January 2001 to February 2018. Exclusions: studies in overweight/obese children and obesity treatments, no comparator group. Evidence was characterized across the early life course and multiple-levels of influence.
   Results
   From the 2,180 records identified, 34 met the inclusion criteria. Less than half of the interventions initiated during pregnancy, infancy or preschool reported a significant improvement in a weight-based outcome. All interventions included strategies to influence individual-or interpersonal-level health behaviors, yet few removed obstacles in the healthcare system, physical/built environment, or sociocultural environment. The majority (78%) of the interventions occurred during preschool years, with 63% conducted in early childcare education settings serving low-income families. The health impact of the state-wide and national policies on children under age 6 years remains unclear. There was considerable uncertainty around estimates of the health and economic impacts of obesity prevention interventions and policies.
   Conclusion
   There is a need to intensify early childhood obesity preventive efforts during critical periods of health development in the US. Future studies should estimate the feasibility, program effectiveness, and cost of implementing multilevel obesity prevention interventions and policies. Addressing these research gaps will provide stakeholders with the scientific evidence necessary to facilitate funding and policy decisions to decrease the prevalence of early childhood obesity.

   SCORES; TESTS; PERSONALITIES; CONSISTENCY; GROWTH; CATTLE; SOWS
AB Changes in husbandry systems as well as consumers' increasing demands for animal welfare lead to increasing importance of traits such as handleability and aggressiveness in pigs. However, before using such novel traits for selection decisions, information on genetic parameters for these traits for the specific population is required. Therefore, weight gain and behaviour-related traits were recorded in 1004 pigs (814 Pietrain x German Landrace crossbred, 190 German Landrace purebred) at different ages. Behaviour indicators and tests were assessed and conducted, respectively under commercial farm conditions and included scoring of skin lesions (twice) and behaviour during backtests (twice), injections (once), handling (twice) and weighing (three times). Since behaviour scores often exhibit suboptimal statistical properties for parametric analyses, variance components were estimated using an animal model assuming a normal (Gaussian, GA; all traits) and additionally a binary distribution of variables (BI; using a logit-link function for all behaviour traits). Heritabilities for behavioural traits ranged from 0.02 +/- 0.04 (finishing pig handling test; BI) to 0.36 +/- 0.08 (backtest 2; GA) suggesting that some of the traits are potentially useful for genetic selection (e. g. finishing pig weighing test: h(2) (GA) = 0.20 +/- 0.07). Only minor differences were observed for results from binary and Gaussian analyses of the same traits suggesting that either approach might yield valid results. However, four-fold cross-validation using correlations between breeding values of a sub-set of animals for the sample trait finishing pig weighing score indicated slight superiority of the logit model (r = 0.85 +/- 0.04 vs. r = 0.77 +/- 0.03). Generally, only weak to moderate associations were found between behavioural reactions to the same test at different ages (r(p) <= 0.11 for weighing at different ages; r(p) = 0.30 but r(g) (GA) = 0.84 +/- 0.11 for the backtests) as well as between reactions to different tests. Therefore, for inclusion of behaviour traits into breeding programmes, and considering high labour input required for some tests such as the backtest, it is recommended to assess behaviour during situations that are relevant and identical to practical conditions, while the use of indicator traits generally does not appear to be a very promising alternative.

TI Voxel segmentation-based 3D building detection algorithm for airborne

DT Article
ID EXTRACTION; RECONSTRUCTION; PATTERNS
AB Among traditional Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data representations such as raster grid, triangulated irregular network, point clouds and octree, the explicit 3D nature of voxel-based representation makes it a promising alternative. Despite the benefit of voxel-based representation, voxel-based algorithms have rarely been used for building detection. In this paper, a voxel segmentation-based 3D building detection algorithm is developed for separating building and nonbuilding voxels. The proposed algorithm first voxelizes the LIDAR point cloud into a grayscale voxel structure in which the grayscale of the voxel corresponds to the quantized mean intensity of the LIDAR points within the voxel. The voxelized dataset is segmented into multiple 3D-connected regions depending on the connectivity and grayscale similarity among voxels. The 3D-connected regions corresponding to the building roof and facade are detected sequentially according to characteristics such as their area, density, elevation difference and location. The obtained results for the detected buildings are evaluated by the LIDAR data provided by working group III/4 of ISPRS, which demonstrate a high rate of success. Average completeness, correctness, quality, and kappa coefficient indexes values of 90.0%, 96.0%, 88.1% and 88.7%, respectively, are obtained for buildings.

TI An inhibitory compound produced by a soil isolate of Rhodococcus has
   strong activity against the veterinary pathogen R-equi
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID GENOME; TAXONOMY; BIOSYNTHESIS
AB Complete genome sequencing of dozens of strains of the soil bacterium Rhodococcus has revealed the presence of many cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters, presumably dedicated to the production of small molecules. This has sparked a renewed interest in this underex-plored member of the Actinobacteria as a potential source of new bioactive compounds. Reported here is the discovery of a potent inhibitory molecule produced by a newly isolated strain of Rhodococcus, strain MTM3W5.2. This small inhibitory molecule shows strong activity against all Rhodococcus species tested, including the veterinary pathogen R. equi, and some closely related genera. It is not active against other Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria. A screen of random transposon mutants identified a gene required to produce this inhibitory compound. This gene is a large multi-domain, type I polyketide synthase that is part of a very large multi-gene biosynthetic gene cluster in the chromosome of strain MTM3W5.2. The high resolution mass spectrum of a major chromatogram peak from a broth culture extract of MTM3W5.2 shows the presence of a compound at m/z 911.5490 atomic mass units. This compound is not detected in the culture extracts from a non-producing mutant strain of MTM3W5.2. A large gene cluster containing at least 14 different type I polyketide synthase genes is proposed to be required to synthesize this antibiotic-like compound.

TI Discrepancy between invasive and non-invasive blood pressure readings in
   extremely preterm infants in the first four weeks of life
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIRTH-WEIGHT; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT; ACCURACY; NEONATE
AB Background
   The agreement between invasive and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) readings in the first days of life of preterm infants is contentiously debated.
   Objective
   To compare mean, systolic and diastolic invasive (IBP) and non-invasive BP (NBP) readings obtained during routine care in the first four weeks of life of extremely preterm infants.
   Methods
   We extracted pairs of IBP and NBP readings obtained from preterm infants born below 28 weeks of gestation from the local database. After exclusion of erroneous measurements, we investigated the repeated measures correlation and analyzed the agreement (bias) and precision adjusted for multiple measurements per individual.
   Results
   Among 335 pairs of IBP and NBP readings obtained from 128 patients, we found correlation coefficients >0.65 for mean, systolic and diastolic BP values. The bias for mean BP readings was -0.4 mmHg (SD 6.1), for systolic BP readings 6.2 mmHg (SD 8.1), and for diastolic BP readings -4.3 mmHg (SD 6.5). Overestimation of systolic IBP and underestimation of diastolic IBP by the non-invasive measurement were found both in the group with gestational age from 23 to 25.9 weeks and in the group with gestational age from 26 to 27.9 weeks. Systolic NBP readings tended to exceed invasive readings in the range <50 mmHg (bias 9.9 mmHg) whereas diastolic NBP readings were lower than invasive values particularly in the range > 30 mmHg (bias -5.5 mmHg).
   Conclusion
   The disagreement between invasive and non-invasive BP readings in infants extends to the first four weeks of life. Biases differ for mean, systolic and diastolic BP values. Our observation implies that they may depend on the range of the blood pressure. Awareness of these biases and preemptive concomitant use of IBP and NPB readings may contribute to reducing over- or under-treatment.

TI The effects of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt on the
   diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PORTAL-VEIN THROMBOSIS; CARCINOMA; CT
AB Background and aims
   Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be placed to treat complications of portal hypertension by creating a conduit between the hepatic and portal vein. The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is typically made by multiphasic imaging studies demonstrating arterial enhancement with washout on arterial, portal venous, and delayed phase imaging. The aim of our study was to determine how the presence of TIPS would affect the imaging diagnosis of HCC.
   Methods
   This was a single-center electronic database review of all patients who underwent multiphasic imaging with MRI or CT scan for HCC screening between January 2000 and July 2017 and who were subsequently diagnosed with HCC. Data collected included patient demographics, liver disease characteristics including CPT score, MELD-Na, AFP, type of imaging, tumor stage, and lab values at the time of HCC diagnosis. The diagnosis of HCC was made using LI-RADS criteria on contrast-enhanced CT or MR imaging and confirmed by chart abstraction as documented by the treating clinician. Demographic and imaging characteristics for HCC patients with and without TIPS were compared.
   Results
   A total of 279 patients met eligibility criteria for the study, 37 (13.2%) of whom had TIPS placed prior to diagnosis of HCC. There was no significant difference in demographics or liver disease characteristics between patients with and without TIPS. Compared to cirrhotic patients with no TIPS prior to HCC diagnosis, patients with TIPS had significantly more scans with a longer duration of surveillance until HCC diagnosis. However, LI-RADS criteria and stage of HCC at diagnosis were not significantly different between both groups. There were no differences in outcomes including liver transplant and survival.
   Conclusion
   The presence of TIPS does not lead to a delayed diagnosis of HCC. It is associated, however, with greater duration of time from first scan to diagnosis of HCC.

AB Viral marketing has been one of the main marketing modes. However, theoretical study of viral marketing is still lacking. This paper focuses on the problem of developing a cost-effective dynamic discount pricing strategy for a viral marketing campaign. First, based on a novel word-of-mouth propagation model, we model the original problem as an optimal control problem. Second, we show that the optimal control problem admits an optimal control and present the optimality system for solving the optimal control problem. Next, we solve some optimal control models to get their respective optimal dynamic discount pricing strategies. Finally, we examine the effect of some factors on the maximum marketing profit. These results contribute to gaining insight into viral marketing.

TI Motorcycle door crashes: An evaluation of crash characteristics in
   Taipei City, Taiwan
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INJURIES; CYCLISTS; ROAD
AB Objectives
   Crashes due to motorcyclists colliding with an open car door can cause devastating injuries. In Taiwan, such crashes typically occur when the motorcyclist is travelling alongside a row of parallel-parked cars, and a driver suddenly opens the door in front of or next to the motorcycle without determining whether it is safe to do so. Injuries resulting from motorcycle door crashes tend to be severe. This study examined the factors that contribute to motorcycle door crashes.
   Methods
   By using linked data from the National Traffic Crash Dataset and Emergency Medical Service for Taipei City for the years 2010-2015, this study estimated a mixed multinomial logit model to predict the likelihood of three types of door crashes: driver-door crashes, left passenger-door crashes, and right passenger-door crashes.
   Results
   Data on 8237 motorcycle door crashes were extracted from the two datasets and matched. The results from the mixed multinomial logit model revealed that illegal parking, older car occupants, teenage car occupants, intoxicated car occupants and motorcyclists, and motorcycle speeding contribute to driver-door crashes; and female passengers and taxis as the type of vehicle involved in crash are associated with left passenger-door crashes.
   Conclusions
   Our study suggested that controlling motorcycle speed, and prosecuting illegal parking and drink driving/riding may constitute effective countermeasures. The "Dutch Reach" intervention measure, which is commonly adopted in Europe for bicycle door crashes, should be applied in Taiwan to curb motorcycle door crashes, especially for elderly car occupants.

AB Mounting evidence from both cognitive and neuropsychological research points to the importance of conceptual and lexical-semantic contributors to short-term memory performance. Nonetheless, a standardized and well-controlled measure to assess semantic short-term memory was only recently developed for English-speakers, and no parallel measure exists for Spanish-speakers. In the conceptual replication and extension reported here, we develop and validate a Spanish adaptation of the Conceptual Span task as a tool to measure the semantic component of short-term memory. Two versions of the task were validated, the Clustered and the Non-Clustered Conceptual Span task, both in separate samples of 64 and 105 Spanish-speaking university students. We found that both versions of the Conceptual Span task correlate well with another widely used standardized measure of working memory capacity, the Reading Span task. The two versions also correlated, as expected, with discrimination of linguistic congruency as assessed by a semantic anomaly judgment task. Clustered Conceptual Span remained a significant predictor of Reading Span when controlling for several additional cognitive variables, including fluid reasoning, text comprehension, verbal fluency, ideational fluency, and speed of processing. Our results present evidence that the Spanish adaptation of both versions of the Conceptual Span task can yield reliable estimates of the active maintenance of semantic representations in verbal working memory-an under-investigated ability that is involved in diverse domains such as episodic memory retrieval, language processing, and comprehension. Thus, the Conceptual Span task validated here can be employed to predict individual variation in semantic short-term memory capacity in a broad range of research domains.

AB Background
   Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a fetal defect comprising an incomplete diaphragm and the herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity that interfere with fetal pulmonary development. Though the most promising treatment for CDH is via interventional fetoscopic tracheal occlusion (TO) surgery in-utero, it has produced mixed results due to the static nature of the inserted occlusion. We hypothesize that a suitable noninvasively-actuatable, cyclic-release tracheal occlusion device can be developed to enable dynamic tracheal occlusion (dTO) implementation.
   Objective
   To conduct an in-vitro proof-of-concept investigation of the construction of thermo-responsive polymer valves designed for targeted activation within a physiologically realizable temperature range as a first step towards potential development of a noninvasively-actuatable implantable device to facilitate dynamic tracheal occlusion (dTO) therapy.
   Methods
   Six thermo-responsive polymer valves, with a critical solution temperature slightly higher than normal physiological body temperature of 37 degrees C, were fabricated using a copolymer of n-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and dimethylacrylamide (DMAA). Three of the valves underwent ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilization while the other three served as controls for EtO-processing compatibility testing. Thermal response actuation of the valves and their steady-state flow performances were evaluated using water and caprine amniotic fluid.
   Results
   All six valves consisting of 0.3-mole fraction of DMAA were tested for thermal actuation of caprine amniotic fluid flow at temperatures ranging from 30-44 degrees C. They all exhibited initiation of valve actuation opening at similar to 40 degrees C with full completion at similar to 44 degrees C. The overall average coefficient of variation (CV) for the day-to-day flow performance of the valves tested was less than 12%. Based on a Student t-test, there was no significant difference in the operational characteristics for the EtO processed versus the non-EtO processed valves tested.
   Conclusions We successfully fabricated and demonstrated physiological realizable temperature range operation of thermo-responsive polymer valves in-vitro and their suitability for standard EtO sterilization processing, a prerequisite for future in-vivo surgical implantation testing.

AB Ischemia reperfusion injury is associated with tissue damage and inflammation, and is one of the main factors causing flap failure in reconstructive microsurgery. Although ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a well-studied aspect of flap survival, its biological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To better understand the biological processes of ischemia reperfusion injury, and to develop further therapeutic strategies, the main objective of this study was to identify the gene expression pattern and histological changes in an I/R injury animal model. Fourteen rats (n = 7/group) were randomly divided into control or ischemia-reperfusion group (8 hours of ischemia). Microsurgical anastomoses were objectively assessed using transit-time-ultrasound technology. Seven days after surgery, flap survival was evaluated and tissue samples were harvested for anatomopathological and gene-expression analyses. The I/R injury reduced the survival of free flaps and histological analyses revealed a subcutaneous edema together with an inflammatory infiltrate. Interestingly, the Arginase 1 expression level as well as the ratio of Arginase 1/Nitric oxide synthase 2 showed a significant increase in the I/R group. In summary, here we describe a well-characterized I/R animal model that may serve to evaluate therapeutic agents under reproducible and controlled conditions. Moreover, this model could be especially useful for the evaluation of arginase inhibitors and different compounds of potential interest in reconstructive microsurgery.

AB Sexually dichromatic birds often show delayed plumage maturation, but second-year (SY) males may or may not be distinguishable from females. In competitive contexts, SY males receive a reduced amount of adult males' aggression, either by mimicking females or through signaling their sex and inexperience as subordinate males. To the human eye, reproductive dull SY male Saffron Finches are indistinguishable from females, whereas after second-year (ASY) males are golden yellow. Our aim is to establish whether SY males are sexually dichromatic with females to the eye of conspecifics. We describe plumage variation in females, SY and ASY males and, in particular, analyze assortative mating by color by comparing a previously disregarded yellow feather patch shared by the three groups. We measured plumage reflectance of the forehead, breast, belly, and axillaries, and used a two-step avian visual model analysis to estimate the ability of Saffron Finches to distinguish between SY males and females. We find that those groups are indistinguishable to conspecifics by color. Furthermore, we find non-significant evidence of assortative mating directly related to the coloration of comparable feather patches between females and each type of male, though body condition of SY males is associated to that of their mates. Our results are compatible with both the female-mimicry and the status signaling hypotheses of evolution and maintenance of delayed plumage maturation. However, the singing behavior of males reveals their presence within the breeding site; the combined effect of song and dull coloration suggest that SY males are honestly revealing their sex and status to conspecifics.

AB Gut microbial structure in animals depends on the host, dietary habits and local environment. A random event, dietary change or antibiotic treatment may alter the gut environment with possible repercussions for the bacterial community composition and functionality and ultimately host fitness. The present study was focused on the composition, structure and functionality of gut microbiota in Reticulitermes grassei and the data obtained was compared with sequence surveys of three other Reticulitermes species. Each Reticulitermes species had a significantly different bacterial gut microbiota (pairwise significance tests using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but a similar pattern of distribution (P-test in weighted Unifrac). The core gut microbiota from the analyzed Reticulitermes species contained 16 bacterial operational taxonomic units. Enzymes (KO) were detected from 14 pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. R. grassei and R. hesperus, based on relative abundance of KO, had the most similar carbohydrate pathway patterns. In addition, we described the gut microbiota and functionality pathways in R. grassei after a 7-day dietary shift and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) treatment. Both factors, but above all the antibiotic, altered the relative abundance of certain microbial groups, although the changes were not statistically significant (P-test in weighted Unifrac). The cellulose diet enhanced the carbohydrate pathways related to propanoate, butanoate, ascorbate, and glyoxylate metabolism. The antibiotic treatment affected galactose metabolism, the citrate cycle and inositol phosphate metabolism. Those functional changes may be related to changes in the abundance of several bacterial groups. Our findings provide insights into the stability of the gut microbiota in R. grassei and a resilience response to dietary shift or antibiotic treatment disturbance after 7 days.

AB The majority of cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis, hence improved methods to biologically and computationally model metastasis are required. Computational models rely on robust data that is machine-readable. The current methods used to model metastasis in mice involve generating primary tumors by injecting human cells into immune-compromised mice, or by examining genetically engineered mice that are pre-disposed to tumor development and that eventually metastasize. The degree of metastasis can be measured using flow cytometry, bioluminescence imaging, quantitative PCR, and/or by manually counting individual lesions from metastatic tissue sections. The aforementioned methods are time-consuming and do not provide information on size distribution or spatial localization of individual metastatic lesions. In this work, we describe and provide a MATLAB script for an image-processing based method designed to obtain quantitative data from tissue sections comprised of multiple subpopulations of disseminated cells localized at metastatic sites in vivo. We further show that this method can be easily adapted for high throughput imaging of live or fixed cells in vitro under a multitude of conditions in order to assess clonal fitness and evolution. The inherent variation in mouse studies, increasing complexity in experimental design which incorporate fate-mapping of individual cells, result in the need for a large cohort of mice to generate a robust dataset. High-throughput imaging techniques such as the one that we describe will enhance the data that can be used as input for the development of computational models aimed at modeling the metastatic process.

TI Veterans' compensation claims beliefs predict timing of PTSD treatment

AB Introduction
   In this study we developed the Disability Beliefs Scale to assess Veterans' beliefs that engaging in treatment, as well as other behaviors, would affect the likelihood of a Veteran's being awarded disability-related benefits. We posited that Veterans with stronger beliefs that attending mental health treatment would facilitate a service-connection award would be more likely to attend PTSD treatment before their compensation and pension examinations for PTSD.
   Methods
   Electronic health records for 307 post-9/11-era Veterans applying for compensation and pension for service-connected PTSD and engaging in a clinical trial of a treatment-referral intervention were analyzed for PTSD-specific and more general mental health treatment use around the time of their compensation examinations. All participants completed the Disability Beliefs Scale and other baseline assessments. Multilevel models assessed change in treatment use as a function of time relative to the C&P exam, compensation examination status (before or after), and the interaction between examination status and beliefs about treatment benefits.
   Results
   No main effects of time or examination status were observed. As hypothesized, beliefs about treatment benefits moderated the effect of examination status on PTSD treatment use. Veterans believing more strongly that mental health treatment would help a claim differentially attended PTSD treatment before the examination than after. The effect was not observed for general mental health treatment use.
   Conclusion
   The association between Veterans' use of PTSD treatment and their service-connection examination status was moderated by beliefs that receiving treatment affects the service-connection decision. This suggests that factors reported to motivate seeking service-connection-finances, validation of Veterans' experiences, and the involvement of significant others-might also help motivate Veterans' use of effective PTSD treatments. However, the results reflect correlations that could be explained in other ways, and service-connection was one of many factors impacting PTSD treatment engagement.

AB Human herpesviruses (HHV) cause a variety of clinically relevant conditions upon primary infection of typically young and immunocompetent hosts. Both primary infection and reactivation after latency can lead to more severe disease, such as encephalitis, congenital defects and cancer. Infections with HHV are also associated with cardiovascular and neuro-degenerative disease. However, most of the associations are based on retrospective case-control analyses and well-powered prospective cohort studies are needed for assessing temporality and causality. To enable comprehensive investigations of HHV-related disease etiology in large prospective population-based cohort studies, we developed HHV Multiplex Serology. This methodology represents a low-cost, high-throughput technology that allows simultaneous measurement of specific antibodies against five HHV species: Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus. The newly developed HHV species-specific ('Monoplex') assays were validated against established gold-standard reference assays. The specificity and sensitivity of the HHV species-specific Monoplex Serology assays ranged from 92.3% to 100.0% (median 97.4%) and 91.8% to 98.7% (median 96.6%), respectively. Concordance with reference assays was very high with kappa values ranging from 0.86 to 0.96 (median kappa 0.93). Multiplexing the Monoplex Serology assays resulted in no loss of performance and allows simultaneous detection of antibodies against the 5 HHV species in a high-throughput manner.

AB Northwestern China, an important part of the Silk Road, was the birthplace of the Zhouzu farming culture. The domestication of cattle as an important aspect of farming culture has had a long history in northwestern China. In this study, we assessed the maternal structure and phylogeny of cattle by analyzing the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) in 698 native cattle from eight areas of northwestern China. The phylogenetic analyses revealed two highly divergent mtDNA clades: clade T, which had four sub-clades (Ta-Td), and clade I. The cattle domesticated from Bos taurus showed a clear dominant distribution pattern in northwestern China. The nucleotide diversity of the Bos indicus clade was lower than that of clades from Bos taurus. In summary, our results suggest that the native cattle of northwestern China were domesticated from two different maternal ancestors, Bos taurus and Bos indicus, which migrated to the central plains of China from the north and south, respectively, with Bos taurus remaining at the edges of the region. The population expansion of the cattle domesticated from Bos taurus occurred in the Longdong region of Gansu Province, and these cattle formed four relatively independent evolutionary branches. Subsequent to this expansion event, Bos indicus migrated from southern to northern China.

TI Evaluation of the factor structure of the Canine Behavioural Assessment

AB The human-dog relationship is thought to be the oldest domestic animal partnership. These relationships are complex and can become problematic when they become dysfunctional. The most common signs of dysfunctional human-dog partnerships are behaviour problems that, when unidentified and uncorrected, can be a clear danger to both species and the public. The Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) is a widely implemented instrument to evaluate dog behaviour proven to be useful across various cultures. A European Portuguese 78-item version based on the 100-item C-BARQ was developed and its psychometric properties evaluated. The resulting questionnaire has a 13-factor structure accounting for 58.42% of the total variance with Cronbach's alpha values ranging from 0.902 and 0.721, showing excellent to respectable consistency. The original factors, Dog-Directed Aggression and Dog-Directed Fear, both loaded strongly onto a joint factor renamed Dog Associated Fear/Aggression, explaining the 13-factor structure compared to the previously found 14-factor structure. In the European Portuguese C-BARQ only two items did not load onto their expected factor. Results show that the questionnaire measures universal dog behaviours that are evident to most owners. Our results suggest that the European Portuguese version of the C-BARQ can be used to characterize the behaviour of dog populations and is adequate for use in animal shelters to help match dogs with new owners and in clinical settings to identify behaviour problems in veterinary patients before they become unmanageable. The European Portuguese C-BARQ could be of vital importance in helping to resolve behavioural problems in owned dogs before they become so serious as to lead to abandonment or euthanasia, diminishing the pressure on municipal kennels and greatly improving canine welfare.

ID ACCURATE; CELLS
AB Antibody array analysis of labeled proteomes has high throughput and is simple to perform, but validation remains challenging. Here, we used differential detergent fractionation and size exclusion chromatography in sequence for high-resolution separation of biotinylated proteins from human primary keratinocytes and leukocytes. Ninety-six sample fractions from each cell type were analyzed with microsphere-based antibody arrays and flow cytometry (microsphere affinity proteomics; MAP). Monomeric proteins and multi-molecular complexes in the cytosol, cytoplasmic organelles, membranes and nuclei were resolved as discrete peaks of antibody reactivity across the fractions. The fractionation also provided a two-dimensional matrix for assessment of specificity. Thus, antibody reactivity peaks were considered to represent specific binding if the position in the matrix was in agreement with published information about i) subcellular location, ii) size of the intended target, and iii) cell type-dependent variation in protein expression. Similarities in the reactivity patterns of either different antibodies to the same protein or antibodies to similar proteins were used as additional supporting evidence. This approach provided validation of several hundred proteins and identification of monomeric proteins and protein complexes. High-resolution MAP solves many of the problems associated with obtaining specificity with immobilized antibodies and a protein label. Thus, laboratories with access to chromatography and flow cytometry can perform large-scale protein analysis on a daily basis. This opens new possibilities for cell biology research in dermatology and validation of antibodies.

   SEQUENCE
AB Background
   The pattern of binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 18 epitopes on human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-"conformational fingerprint of ACE"-is a sensitive marker of subtle conformational changes of ACE due to mutations, different glycosylation in various cells, the presence of ACE inhibitors and specific effectors, etc.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We described in detail the methodology of the conformational fingerprinting of human blood and tissue ACEs that allows detecting differences in surface topography of ACE from different tissues, as well detecting inter-individual differences. Besides, we compared the sensitivity of the detection of ACE inhibitors in the patient's plasma using conformational fingerprinting of ACE (with only 2 mAbs to ACE, 1G12 and 9B9) and already accepted kinetic assay and demonstrated that the mAbs-based assay is an order of magnitude more sensitive. This approach is also very effective in detection of known (like bilirubin and lysozyme) and still unknown ACE effectors/inhibitors which nature and set could vary in different tissues or different patients.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Phenotyping of ACE (and conformational fingerprinting of ACE as a part of this novel approach for characterization of ACE) in individuals really became informative and clinically relevant. Appreciation (and counting on) of inter-individual differences in ACE conformation and accompanying effectors make the application of this approach for future personalized medicine with ACE inhibitors more accurate. This (or similar) methodology can be applied to any enzyme/protein for which there is a number of mAbs to its different epitopes.

TI Efficient algorithms for Longest Common Subsequence of two bucket orders
   to speed up pairwise genetic map comparison
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID R-PACKAGE
AB Genetic maps order genetic markers along chromosomes. They are, for instance, extensively used in marker-assisted selection to accelerate breeding programs. Even for the same species, people often have to deal with several alternative maps obtained using different ordering methods or different datasets, e.g. resulting from different segregating populations. Having efficient tools to identify the consistency and discrepancy of alternative maps is thus essential to facilitate genetic map comparisons. We propose to encode genetic maps by bucket order, a kind of order, which takes into account the blurred parts of the marker order while being an efficient data structure to achieve low complexity algorithms. The main result of this paper is an O(n log(n)) procedure to identify the largest agreements between two bucket orders of n elements, their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), providing an efficient solution to highlight discrepancies between two genetic maps. The LCS of two maps, being the largest set of their collinear markers, is used as a building block to compute pairwise map congruence, to visually emphasize maker collinearity and in some scaffolding methods relying on genetic maps to improve genome assembly. As the LCS computation is a key subroutine of all these genetic map related tools, replacing the current LCS subroutine of those methods by ours - to do the exact same work but faster-could significantly speed up those methods without changing their accuracy. To ease such transition we provide all required algorithmic details in this self contained paper as well as an R package implementing them, named LCSLCIS, which is freely available at: https://github.com/holtzy/LCSLCIS.

TI Do young black men who have sex with men in the deep south prefer
   traditional over alternative STI testing?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTION; MYCOPLASMA-GENITALIUM; HIV; HEALTH;
   PERFORMANCE; CHLAMYDIA
AB Background
   High sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates in the South, especially among young black men who have sex with men (YB MSM), make STI testing imperative for public health.
   Purpose
   To identify STI testing preferences in this population to improve testing delivery and utilization.
   Methods
   YB MSM ages 16-35 in Birmingham, Alabama participated in focus groups (FG). A trained qualitative researcher coded transcripts after each FG and added questions to explore emerging themes.
   Results
   Between September 2017 and January 2018, 36 YB MSM participated in 5 focus groups. Median age was 25.5 (Interquartile range 22-30). Participants preferred STI testing at doctors' offices conducted by physicians but they also preferred having options related to testing locations, frequency, and timing to address diverse needs. Participants did not prefer testing by non-physician staff or home self-testing.
   Conclusion
   A variety of options, including varied locations, personnel, and methods (self-collected and provider collected) are needed to make patient-preferred STI testing a reality among YB MSM in the Deep South. Further, the desire to be tested by a trusted physician highlights the need for access to primary care providers. Results suggest that newer home-based tests and self-collected tests are less preferable to YB MSM in the South, which deserves further study as these tests are rapidly integrated into clinical care.

   HYPOTHESIS; DOPAMINE; DISORDER; AVERSION; BEHAVIOR
AB Backgrounds
   The prevalence of toxoplasmosis is higher in schizophrenics than in the general population. It has been suggested that certain symptoms of schizophrenia, including changes in olfactory functions, are in fact symptoms of toxoplasmosis that can be easily detected in schizophrenics only due to the increased prevalence of toxoplasmosis in this population. Schizophrenics have impaired identification of odors and lower sensitivity of odor detection, however, no information about these parameters of non-schizophrenic Toxoplasma-infected subjects is available.
   Methods
   Here we searched for differences in olfactory functions between 62 infected and 61 noninfected non-schizophrenic subjects using the case-controls experimental design.
   Results
   The infected men scored better than the non-infected controls in the standard odor-identification test. The infected women rated all smells as more intensive while the infected men rated nearly all smells as less intensive. Infected women rated the pleasantness of the smell of the cat urine as higher than the non-infected women and the opposite was true for the men-in contrast, higher pleasantness of odor in infected men and lower in infected women were observed and described in the 2011 study. Toxoplasmosis, Rh, and toxoplasmosis-Rh interaction were not associated with the rated pleasantness of the smell of other stimuli. However, our sample contained only 17 Rh negative men and 30 Rh negative women. Therefore, all results concerning the main effects of Rh factor and the interaction with Rh factor must be considered only preliminary.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that latent toxoplasmosis is associated with changes in the olfactory functions in humans; however, the observed changes differ from those observed in schizophrenics.

AB Bacterial and fungal infections still remain an important cause of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies and in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) especially in developing countries like India. Granulocyte transfusions (GTX) from healthy donors may lead to early clearance of index infection and thus prevent mortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GTX in combating life-threatening infections and preventing mortality in patients of hematological disorders/recipients of HSCT with severe neutropenia. This study was a prospective, observational analysis of patients with different hematological disorders/recipients of HSCT, who received GTX from January 2014 to December 2017. All patients had an Absolute neutrophil Count (ANC) < 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a life threatening sepsis defined by presence of hemodynamic instability/impending septic shock/continuous high fever despite the use of the highest line of antimicrobials. A total of 143 granulocyte collections were done for 66 infectious episodes (IEs) in 60 patients. Multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) were observed in 47/66 IEs (71.2%) and fungal infections were seen in 9/66 IEs (13.6%). Resolution of index infection after GTX was seen in 45/66 IEs (68.2%), and the 30 day overall survival (OS) was 67.7%. OS was significantly higher in patients who received GTX within 7 days of neutropenic sepsis (p = 0.01). Patients with MDROs who received early GTX therapy had a better OS as compared to those who received late GTX (p = 0.02). GTX were well tolerated and only 6 patients' developed mild features of transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) which was managed conservatively, and 1 patient demonstrated hypocalcemic tetany. GTX may be of particular relevance in countries like India, where the incidence of infections is very high in neutropenic patients and there is an increasing emergence of MDROs.

AB Bagrada hilaris Burmeister, is a stink bug native to Asia and Africa and invasive in the United States, Mexico, and more recently, South America. This species can cause serious damage to various vegetable crops in the genus Brassica, with seedlings being particularly susceptible to B. hilaris feeding activity. In this study, the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by seedlings of three Brassica species on the host preference of B. hilaris was evaluated. In dual choice arena and olfactometer bioassays, adult painted bugs preferred B. oleracea var. botrytis and B. napus over B. carinata. Volatiles from B. oleracea seedlings were collected and bioassayed with B. hilaris adults and late stage nymphs, using electroantennographic (EAG) and behavioral (olfactometer) techniques. When crude extracts of the VOCs from B. oleracea var. botrytis seedlings and liquid chromatography fractions thereof were bioassayed, B. hilaris adults and nymphs were attracted to the crude extract, and to a non-polar fraction containing hydrocarbons, whereas there were no responses to the more polar fractions. GC-MS analysis indicated that the main constituents of the non-polar fraction was an as yet unidentified diterpene hydrocarbon, with trace amounts of several other diterpene hydrocarbons. The major diterpene occurred in VOCs from both of the preferred host plants B. oleracea and B. napus, but not in VOCs of B. carinata. Our results suggest that this diterpene, alone or in combination with one or more of the minor compounds, is a key mediator in this insect-plant interaction, and could be a good candidate for use in lures for monitoring B. hilaris in the field.

AB This study was designed to examine the potential involvement of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle dysfunction linked with stretching in a mouse model and to explore the effects of combined antioxidant intake on peripheral leukocyte apoptosis following eccentrically-biased downhill runs in human subjects. In the mouse model, diaphragmatic muscle was stretched by 30% of its optimal length, followed by 5-min contraction. Muscle function and extracellular reactive oxygen species release was measured ex vivo. In human models, participants performed two trials of downhill running either with or without antioxidant supplementation, followed by apoptotic assay of inflammatory cells in the blood. The results showed that stretch led to decreased muscle function and prominent ROS increase during muscle contraction. In human models, we observed an elevation in circulating leukocyte apoptosis 24-48 hours following acute downhill runs. However, there is an attenuated leukocyte apoptosis following the second bout of downhill run. Interestingly, the combination of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and a-tocopherol (vitamin E) supplementation attenuated the decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) at 24 hours following acute downhill running. These data collectively suggest that significant ROS formation can be induced by muscle-lengthening associated with eccentric exercise, which is accompanied by compromised muscle function. The combination of antioxidants supplementation appears to have a protective role via the attenuation of decrease in anti-apoptotic protein.

ID APPARENT DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; PERFUSION FRACTION; WEIGHTED MRI;
   TUMORS; LIVER; IVIM
AB In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-derived parameters calculated with three b-values in differentiating high-grade gliomas (HGGs) from low-grade gliomas (LGGs) by comparing those calculated with multiple b-values. Ten patients with LGG (ages 35.1 +/- 12.1 yrs; 4 males, 6 females) and 21 patients with HGG (ages 60.6 +/- 19.1 yrs; 10 males, 11 females) who underwent subsequent surgical resections were examined with both IVIM imaging and histopathological analysis. The IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging was conducted using a single-shot echo planar sequence with 13 b-factors (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 sec/mm(2)) at 3T. In the conventional IVIM analysis, the perfusion fraction (f) and true diffusion coefficient (D) were calculated by biexponential fitting model with 13 b-values. In the simplified method with the selected three b-values (0, 300, and 1000 sec/mm(2)), D simply corresponds to the slope of a straight line passing through two logarithmic signal intensities (SIs) at the b-values of 300 and 1000 s/mm(2), and f corresponds to the difference between the intercept of this line and SI at the b-value of 0 sec/mm(2). The maximum f (f-max) and minimum D (D-min) was measured in each tumor. The f-max values calculated with three b-values (12.8 +/- 5.9%) were significantly lower than those with 13 b-values (17.3 +/- 7.5%, p<0.0001), but a good correlation and agreement were observed between these sets of f-max values (r = 0.79, ICC = 0.87). In the IVIM imaging with both three and 13 b-values, the HGGs showed significantly higher f-max values compared to the LGGs (p<0.001, respectively). The D-min values calculated with three b-values (1.06 +/- 0.31 x10(-3) mm(2)/sec) was not different from those with 13 b-values (1.07 +/- 0.33 x10(-3) mm(2)/sec), and an excellent correlation and agreement were found between them (r = 0.99, ICC = 0.99). The simplified IVIM imaging using three b-values can efficiently differentiate HGGs and LGGs.

TI Utilization patterns of traditional medicine in Taiwan and South Korea
   by using national health insurance data in 2011
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   The growing popularity of traditional medicine (TM) is reflected in the increasing trend for its use worldwide. Many people are turning to use TM as a complementary or integrative treatment. The aim of this study is to present the first nationwide report describing the use of TM in two countries (South Korea and Taiwan).
   Materials and methods
   To present the TM utilization patterns between South Korea and Taiwan, we analyzed data from the National Health Insurance cohorts in each country, each of which has approximately one million inhabitants.
   Results
   In total, 261,478 (25.5%) of 1,025,340 people in South Korea and 260,529 (26.8%) of 970,866 people in Taiwan used TM services at least once under the National Health Insurance in 2011. Using multivariable logistic regression, TM users in South Korea were significantly more likely to be female, 61-80 years of age and individuals with a high income, and those in Taiwan were significantly more likely to be female, 21-40 years of age and individuals with a middle income. The two countries showed similar utilization patterns in visit seasons. People visited TM clinics more frequently than TM hospitals in both countries. The most common TM treatment in South Korea was acupuncture, whereas in Taiwan, various powdered Chinese herbal preparations were the most commonly used treatment. The most common diseases for people seeking TM services were musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases in South Korea and Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions in Taiwan.
   Conclusion
   According to the National Health Insurance database, about one fourth of the NHI beneficiaries of South Korea and Taiwan had TM use in 2011. Different TM utilization patterns existed between South Korea and Taiwan, which might be due to the differences in insurance coverage between the two countries.

ID PROGRESSION; LENSES; MYOPIA; TRIAL; OCT
AB Purpose
   To compare the axial length measurements obtained by a new swept source optical coherence tomography based biometer-ARGOS with partial coherence interferometry based biometer -IOL master in school children between the ages of 11-17.
   Methods
   A prospective, cross-sectional, device comparison study was conducted in a school vision screening program comparing the axial length (AL) and corneal curvature (K) measurements obtained by two biometers-ARGOS and IOL master. Children with 6/9 vision or better, without any ocular abnormalities were included in the study. Two trained optometrists performed the measurements and were masked for the outcome measures.
   Results
   The sample size was 188 with a mean(SD) age of 13.88 +/- 1.69 years, of which 101 were boys. The mean (SD) AL was 23.94 +/- 1.01 mm with Argos and 23.83 +/- 1.03 mm with IOL Master (paired t-test, p>0.05). The mean K was 43.62D +/- 1.59 with Argos and 43.64D +/- 1.61 with IOL master (paired t-test, p>0.05). There was a strong positive correlation between the biometers for AL (r = 1.00, p<0.0001) and K (r = 0.99, p<0.0001). The mean difference in axial length between the two biometers was 0.11 +/- 0.04 mm and the limits of agreement were between -0.02 to -0.19. The mean difference in corneal curvature was 0.02 +/- 0.15D and the limits of agreement were between -0.28 to 0.32D.
   Conclusion
   Axial length measurements using SS-OCT and PCI based biometers were in agreement and comparable among children between the ages of 11 to 17.

TI The effect of antiretroviral treatment on selected genes in whole blood
   from HIV-infected adults sensitised by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CD4(+) T-CELLS; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; RESPONSES
AB HIV-1 co-infection is a leading cause of susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB), with the risk of TB being increased at all stages of HIV-1 infection. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the most effective way to reduce the risk of TB in HIV-1 co-infected people. Studying protective, ART-induced, immune restoration in HIV-1 infected individuals sensitised by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can thus help identify mechanisms of protection against TB. In order to understand ART-mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected adults, we investigated the expression of 30 genes in whole blood from HIV-1 infected patients during the first 6 months of ART-induced immune reconstitution. The 30 selected genes were previously described to be differentially expressed between sorted Mtb specific central and effector memory CD4 T cells. HIV-1 infected persons sensitised by Mtb were recruited in Khayelitsha, South Africa, when initiating ART. RNA was extracted from whole blood at initiation and 1, 3 and 6 months of ART. qRT-PCR was used to determine gene expression and three reference 'housekeeping' genes were used to calculate the fold change in the expression of each gene relative to day 0 of ART. Results were assessed longitudinally. We observed a decrease in the expression of a number of genes at 6 months of ART, reflecting a decrease in immune activation. However, following correction for multiple comparisons and increasing CD4 counts, only the decrease in CD27 gene expression remained statistically significant. While not statistically significant, a number of genes also showed increased expression at various timepoints, illustrating the broad regeneration of the T cell pool in HIV-1 infected adults on ART. Our findings generate hypotheses underlying ART-induced protective immune reconstitution and may pave the way for future studies to evaluate ART mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected persons.

AB The WRKY proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors that have been known to play a wide range of regulatory roles in multiple biological processes. Over the past few years, many reports have focused on analysis of evolution and biological function of WRKY genes at the whole genome level in different plant species. However, little information is known about WRKY genes in melon (Cucumis melo L.). In the present study, a total of 56 putative WRKY genes were identified in melon, which were randomly distributed on their respective chromosomes. A multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis using melon, cucumber and watermelon predicted WRKY domains indicated that melon WRKY proteins could be classified into three main groups (I-III). Our analysis indicated that no recent duplication events of WRKY genes were detected in melon, and strong purifying selection was observed among the 85 orthologous pairs of Cucurbitaceae species. Expression profiles of CmWRKY derived from RNA-seq data and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed distinct expression patterns in various tissues, and the expression of 16 CmWRKY were altered following powdery mildew infection in melon. Besides, we also found that a total of 24 WRKY genes were co-expressed with 11 VQ family genes in melon. Our comparative genomic analysis provides a foundation for future functional dissection and understanding the evolution of WRKY genes in cucurbitaceae species, and will promote powdery mildew resistance study in melon.

TI The use of Fionet technology for external quality control of malaria
   rapid diagnostic tests and monitoring health workers' performance in
   rural military health facilities in Tanzania
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB Introduction
   Internal and external quality control (QC) of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is important to increase reliability of RDTs currently used to diagnose malaria. However, cross-checking of used RDTs as part of quality assurance can rarely be done by off-site personnel because there is no guarantee of retaining visible test lines after manufacturers' recommended reading time. Therefore, this study examined the potential of using Fionet (TM) technology for remote RDT quality monitoring at seven clinics, identifying reasons for making RDT processing and interpretation errors, and taking corrective actions for improvement of diagnosis and consequently improved management of febrile patients
   Methods
   The study was conducted at seven military health facilities in Mainland Tanzania and utilized RDTs capable of detecting Plasmodium falciparum specific Histidine-rich protein 2 (Pf-HRP2) and the genus specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) for other species of plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malariae or P. ovale; pan-pLDH). Patients' data and images of processed RDTs from seven clinics were uploaded on a Fionet web portal and reviewed regularly to monitor preparation procedures and visual interpretation of test results compared to automated analysis using the Deki reader of RDT. Problems detected were rapidly communicated to remote laboratory personnel at the clinic for corrective action and follow-up of patients who were falsely diagnosed as negative and missed treatment. Factors contributing to making errors in visual interpretation of RDT results were analyzed during visits to the health facilities.
   Results
   A total of 1,367 (1.6%) out of 83,294 RDT test images uploaded to the Fionet portal had discordant test results of which 822 (60.1%) and 545 (39.9%) were falsely reported as negative and positive, respectively. False negative and false positive test results were common for a single test line in 515 (62.7%) and 741 (54.2%) tests, respectively. Out of 1,367 RDT images assessed, 98 (7.2%) had quality problems related to preparation procedures of which 95 (96.9%) errors were due to putting too much blood on the sample well or insufficient buffer in the respective wells. The reasons for discrepant results included, false reporting of none existent lines in 526 (38.5%) tests, missing a faint positive line in 493 (36.1%), missing a strong positive line in 248(18.1%) and errors caused by poorly processed RDTs in 96 (7.2%) tests. Among the false negative tests (n = 822), 669 (48.9%) patients were eligible for follow-up and only 339 (48.5%) were reached and 291 (85.8%) received appropriate anti-malaria therapy.
   Conclusion
   Fionet technology enabled remote monitoring of RDT quality issues, identifying reasons contributing to laboratory personnel making errors and provided a rapid method to implement corrective actions at remote sites to improve malaria diagnosis and consequently improved health care management of febrile patients infected with malaria.

AB The current marketing landscape, apart from conventional approaches, consists of campaigns designed especially for launching information diffusion processes within online networks. Associated research is focused on information propagation models, campaign initialization strategies and factors affecting campaign dynamics. In terms of algorithms and performance evaluation, the final coverage represented by the fraction of activated nodes within a target network is usually used. It is not necessarily consistent with the real marketing campaigns using various characteristics and parameters related to coverage, costs, behavioral patterns and time factors for overall evaluation. This paper presents assumptions for a decision support system for multi-criteria campaign planning and evaluation with inputs from agent-based simulations. The results, which are delivered from a simulation model based on synthetic networks in a form of decision scenarios, are verified within a real network. Last, but not least, the study proposes a multi-objective campaign evaluation framework with several campaign evaluation metrics integrated. The results showed that the recommendations generated with the use of synthetic networks applied to real networks delivered results according to the decision makers' expectation in terms of the used evaluation criteria. Apart from practical applications, the proposed multi-objective approach creates new evaluation possibilities for theoretical studies focused on information spreading processes within complex networks.

AB The present study was aimed to develop a liposomal formulation of thymoquinone (Lip-TQ) to treat Candida albicans infection in diabetic mice. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected to induce hyperglycemia and on day 3 post STZ administration, mice were intravenously infected with C. albicans. Various doses (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) of Free or Lip-TQ were administered in C. albicans infected diabetic mice. The effect of Lip-TQ was also determined on the organ indices, liver and kidney function parameters. Lip-TQ at a dose of 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the level of the blood glucose and alleviated the systemic C. albicans infection in diabetic mice. C. albicans infected diabetic mice treated with Lip-TQ at a dose of 10 mg/kg showed the survival rate of 70% as compared to that of 20% in the group treated with free TQ. The treatment with Lip-TQ resulted in the recovery of the organ indices, liver inflammation, kidney functioning and pancreas regeneration in diabetic mice. Moreover, TQ formulations also showed the direct therapeutic effect against candidiasis in the untreated or metformin-treated diabetic mice. Therefore, the findings of the present study support the use of Lip-TQ in the treatment of candidiasis in the diabetic patients.

AB Snow is important for local to global climate and surface hydrology, but spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the extent of snow cover make accurate, fine-scale mapping and monitoring of snow an enormous challenge. We took 184,453 daily near-surface images acquired by 133 automated cameras and processed them using crowdsourcing and deep learning to determine whether snow was present or absent in each image. We found that the crowdsourced data had an accuracy of 99.1% when compared with expert evaluation of the same imagery. We then used the image classification to train a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning, with accuracies of 92% to 98%, depending on the image set and training method. The majority of neural network errors were due to snow that was present not being detected. We used the results of the neural networks to validate the presence or absence of snow inferred from the MODIS satellite sensor and obtained similar results to those from other validation studies. This method of using automated sensors, crowdsourcing, and deep learning in combination produced an accurate high temporal dataset of snow presence across a continent. It holds broad potential for real-time large-scale acquisition and processing of ecological and environmental data in support of monitoring, management, and research objectives.

AB Climate change in recent decades has been identified as a significant threat to natural environments and human wellbeing. This is because some of the contemporary changes to climate are abrupt and result in persistent changes in the state of natural systems; so called regime shifts (RS). This study aimed to detect and analyse the timing and strength of RS in Estonian climate at the half-century scale (1966-2013). We demonstrate that the extensive winter warming of the Northern Hemisphere in the late 1980s was represented in atmospheric, terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems to an extent not observed before or after the event within the studied time series. In 1989, abiotic variables displayed statistically significant regime shifts in atmospheric, river and marine systems, but not in lake and bog systems. This was followed by regime shifts in the biotic time series of bogs and marine ecosystems in 1990. However, many biotic time series lacked regime shifts, or the shifts were uncoupled from large-scale atmospheric circulation. We suggest that the latter is possibly due to complex and temporally variable interactions between abiotic and biotic elements with ecosystem properties buffering biotic responses to climate change signals, as well as being affected by concurrent anthropogenic impacts on natural environments.

AB In E. coli, under high pH/high salt conditions, a major Na+/H+ antiporter (NhaA) is activated to maintain an internal pH level. Its expression is induced by a specific regulator NhaR, which is also responsible for osmC and pgaA regulation. Here I report that the NhaR regulator affects the carbon storage regulatory Csr system. I found that the expression of all major components of the Csr system-CsrA regulator, CsrB and CsrC small RNAs, and the CsrB and CsrC stability were indirectly affected by nhaR mutation under stress conditions. Using a combination of experimental and in silico analyses, I concluded that the mechanism of regulation included direct and indirect activation of a two-component system (TCS) response regulator-UvrY. NhaR regulation involved interactions with the regulators H-NS and SdiA and was affected by a naturally occurring spontaneous IS5 insertion in the promoter region. A regulatory circuit was proposed and discussed.

TI Can we achieve universal health coverage without a focus on disability?
   Results from a national case-control study in Guatemala
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; ACCESS; SYSTEMS; PEOPLE
AB Objective
   To compare access to healthcare services for people with disabilities to those without disabilities, within a national case-control study in Guatemala.
   Methods
   We undertook a population-based case-control study, nested within a national survey in Guatemala. Cases with disabilities were people with self-reported difficulties in functioning. One control without disabilities was selected per case, matched by age, gender and cluster. Information was collected on: health status, access to health services and rehabilitation, and socioeconomic status.
   Results
   The study included 707 people with disabilities, and 465 controls. People with disabilities were more likely to report a serious health problem (aOR 2.8, 2.2-3.7) or doctor-diagnosis of one of 17 general health conditions (aOR 2.9, 2.2-3.8) as compared to controls without disabilities. People with disabilities were twice as likely as controls to have received treatment for a diagnosed condition (aOR 2.2, 1.7-2.8). Coverage of treatment for impairment-related health conditions was low, as was awareness and access to rehabilitation services. People with disabilities were more likely than controls to report being disrespected (aOR 1.9, 1.0-3.7) or finding it difficult to understand information given (aOR 1.6, 1.1-1.4).
   Conclusion
   Efforts are needed to raise awareness about rehabilitation services and improve quality of health services for people with disabilities in Guatemala, to ensure that their rights are fulfilled and to assist in the achievement of Universal Health Coverage. Better tools are needed to measure healthcare access, including consideration of geographic access, quality and affordability, to allow the generation of comparable data on access to healthcare among people with disabilities.

AB Measuring oxidative stress has become increasingly valuable in ecological studies, especially when different markers are measured on the same individual. However, many of the current methods lack sensitivity for analysis of low blood volume samples, which represent a challenge for longitudinal field studies of small organisms. Small blood volumes can usually only be analysed by using a single assay, therefore providing limited information on individual's oxidative profile. In this study, we used blood collected from a population of wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and modified methods presented in the literature to improve analytical selectivity and sensitivity required for small blood volumes. Specifically, we proposed a modified malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis protocol by HPLC and also optimized both the uric acid independent ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and hypochlorous acid shock capacity (HASC) assays. Development of the three modified methods was achieved with a sensitivity and repeatability that meets standards of field ecology while allowing measurement of all three assays in duplicate using less than 60 mu L of plasma. Availability of these tests using small blood volumes will provide ecologists with a more comprehensive portrait of an individual's oxidative profile and a better understanding of its determinants and interactions with the environment.

AB In this study, we investigated the effects of context-related semantic anomalies on the fixation-related brain potentials of 12-13-year-old Finnish children in grade 6 during sentence reading. The detection of such anomalies is typically reflected in the N400 event-related potential. We also examined whether the representation invoked by the sentence context extends to the orthographic representation level by replacing the final words of the sentence with an anomalous word neighbour of a plausible word. The eye-movement results show that the anomalous word neighbours of plausible words cause similar first-fixation and gaze duration reactions, as do other anomalous words. Similarly, we observed frontal negativity in the fixation-related potential of the unrelated anomalous words and in the anomalous word neighbours. This frontal negativity was larger in both anomalous conditions than in the response elicited by the plausible condition. We thus show that the brain successfully uses context to separate anomalous words from plausible words on a single letter level during free reading. From the P600 response of the scalp waveform, we observed that the P600 was delayed in the anomalous word neighbour condition. We performed group-level decomposition on the data with ICA (independent component analysis) and analysed the time course and source structure of the decomposed data. This analysis of decomposed brain signals not only confirmed the delay of the P600 response but also revealed that the frontal negativity concealed s more typical and separate N400 response, which was similarly delayed in the anomalous word neighbour condition, as was the P600 response. Source analysis of these independent components implicated the right frontal eye field as the cortical source for the frontal negativity and the middle temporal and parietal regions as cortical sources for the components resembling the N400 and P600 responses. We interpret the delays present in N400 and P600 responses to anomalous word neighbours to reflect competition with the representation of the plausible word just one letter different.

ID NATURE-RESERVE; ASIATIC IBEX; SLEEP; XINJIANG; BUDGET; LIMB
AB Rest contributes a large part of animals' daily life, and animals usually rest in two ways, standing or in recumbence. Small or medium sized ungulates bed to rest in most cases, and standing rest is very rare and hardly seen. Here we described a standing rest behavior of Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) living on the Tibet Plateau which has not been reported before. We named the standing rest behavior Puppet behavior, since the antelope stand still for a certain time. Of the 304 individuals observed, 48.3% (98/203) of adult and sub-adult males expressed the Puppet behavior, whereas only 6.3% (6/96) of females did, indicating an obvious sexual difference. Puppet behavior occurred more frequently at noon and in the afternoon on sunny and cloudy days, meaning that daytime and weather were both influential factors. Puppet behavior was usually accompanied with rumination and sometimes ended with leg-shaking. Our results suggest that Puppet behavior may be an adaptive form of rest, which may serve a thermoregulatory and anti-predation function, and may be simpler and safer than recumbent rest.

TI Perceived stigma of leprosy among community members and health care
   providers in Lalitpur district of Nepal: A qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ELIMINATION; DISEASE
AB Background
   Leprosy remains a major stigmatizing condition. Stigma is a dynamic process resulting from the interaction between physical attributes caused by leprosy and the existing stereotypes in a community. Leprosy has pervasive impacts on all areas of life including psychosocial burden to an individual, social interaction, marriage, and employment. These impacts vary and are largely dependent on a particular culture and community. The main objective of this study was to explore the perceived stigma of leprosy amongst community members and health care providers in Lalitpur district of Nepal.
   Methods
   A total of six focused group discussions (FGDs) with 43 participants from a community living close to Anandaban Leprosy Hospital and ten semi structured interviews (SSIs) with health care providers were conducted between October and December 2016. An interview guide was used for the FGDs and SSIs. All qualitative data were transcribed and translated into English and were thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti software.
   Results
   Visible deformities due to leprosy was one of the major contributing factors for stigma. Stigma was further exacerbated by an attitude to conceal the disease due to perceived fear of potential discrimination. While over the years, stigma was felt to be decreasing, various aspects of life were still affected by leprosy stigma including marriage, employment and social interaction. This was largely attributed to leprosy and its consequences, specifically the disability and deformity caused by leprosy.
   Conclusion
   Leprosy was still perceived to be feared and concealed because of potential discrimination, even within the community that was close to a long established leprosy hospital. Various aspects such as marriage, employment and social interaction were still affected by the stigma which was strongly associated with visible deformities. In addition to ongoing rehabilitation and stigma reduction programs, integrating strategies such as community engagement wherein community and leprosy affected person jointly take a role in stigma reduction programs can be helpful.

   CD2AP; ACTIN; EXPRESSION; CAVIN; MICE; PTRF
AB The mechanisms controlling the abundance and sub-cellular distribution of caveolae are not well described. A first step towards determining such mechanisms would be identification of relevant proteins that interact with known components of caveolae. Here, we applied proximity biotinylation (BioID) to identify a list of proteins that may interact with the caveolar protein cavin1. Screening of these candidates using siRNA to reduce their expression revealed that one of them, CSDE1, regulates the levels of mRNAs and protein expression for multiple components of caveolae. A second candidate, CD2AP, co-precipitated with cavin1. Caveolar proteins were observed in characteristic and previously un-described linear arrays adjacent to cell-cell junctions in both MDCK cells, and in HeLa cells overexpressing an active form of the small GTPase Rac1. CD2AP was required for the recruitment of caveolar proteins to these linear arrays. We conclude that BioID will be useful in identification of new proteins involved in the cell biology of caveolae, and that interaction between CD2AP and cavin1 may have an important role in regulating the sub-cellular distribution of caveolae.

TI Qualitative analysis of manual annotations of clinical text with SNOMED

DT Article
ID ACCURACY; AGREEMENT
AB SNOMED CT provides about 300,000 codes with fine-grained concept definitions to support interoperability of health data. Coding clinical texts with medical terminologies it is not a trivial task and is prone to disagreements between coders. We conducted a qualitative analysis to identify sources of disagreements on an annotation experiment which used a subset of SNOMED CT with some restrictions. A corpus of 20 English clinical text fragments from diverse origins and languages was annotated independently by two domain medically trained annotators following a specific annotation guideline. By following this guideline, the annotators had to assign sets of SNOMED CT codes to noun phrases, together with concept and term coverage ratings. Then, the annotations were manually examined against a reference standard to determine sources of disagreements. Five categories were identified. In our results, the most frequent cause of inter-annotator disagreement was related to human issues. In several cases disagreements revealed gaps in the annotation guidelines and lack of training of annotators. The reminder issues can be influenced by some SNOMED CT features.

AB The comprehensive screening of intracellular and extracellular microRNAs was performed to identify novel tumor suppressors. We found that miR-8073 was present in exosome and predominantly exported from colorectal cancer cells. Treatment with a synthetic miR-8073 mimic resulted in a dramatic decrease in the proliferation of various types of cancer cells, which was not observed in similarly treated normal cells. As little is known about the biological functions of miR-8073, its target mRNAs were analyzed by both mRNA expression and in silico sequence analyses, leading to five probable target candidates (FOXM1, MBD3, CCND1, KLK10, and CASP2) that enhance survival during the regulation of the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. We experimentally confirmed that miR-8073 binds the 3'-UTR of each of these mRNA target candidates and that the introduction of a synthetic miR-8073 mimic into cancer cells reduced levels of protein expression. Finally, the antiproliferative effects of miR-8073 were validated in vivo: the subcutaneous injection of a synthetic miR-8073 mimic suppressed colorectal tumor volume to 43% in tumor-bearing xenografted mice. These results suggest that because miR-8073 binds, and thus reduces the levels of, these oncogenic targets, cancer cells must actively downregulate miR-8073 as a survival mechanism. The introduction of miR-8073 into tumors could thus inhibit tumor growth, indicating its great potential for cancer therapeutics.

AB When many gametes compete to fertilize a limited number of compatible gametes, sexual selection will favour traits that increase competitive success during mating. In animals and plants, sperm and pollen competition have yielded many interesting adaptations for improved mating success. In fungi, similar processes have not been shown directly yet. We test the hypothesis that sexual selection can increase competitive fitness during mating, using experimental evolution in the mushroom-forming fungus Schizophyllum commune (Basidiomycota). Mating in mushroom fungi occurs by donation of nuclei to a mycelium. These fertilizing 'male' nuclei migrate through the receiving 'female' mycelium. In our setup, an evolving population of nuclei was serially mated with a non-evolving female mycelium for 20 sexual generations. From the twelve tested evolved lines, four had increased and one had decreased fitness relative to an unevolved competitor. Even though only two of those five remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, for all five lines we found a correlation between the efficiency with which the female mycelium is accessed and fitness, providing additional circumstantial evidence for fitness change in those five lines. In two lines, fitness change was also accompanied by increased spore production. The one line with net reduced competitive fitness had increased spore production, but reduced fertilisation efficiency. We did not find trade-offs between male reproductive success and other fitness components. We compare these findings with examples of sperm and pollen competition and show that many similarities between these systems and nuclear competition in mushrooms exist.

   population-based study
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL PROGNOSTIC INDEX; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DIAGNOSIS; GUIDELINES;
   SURVIVAL; STAGE
AB Introduction
   The majority of newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are followed initially by watch and wait (WAW). Clinical practice varies and the value of frequent follow-up visits remains unclear. Thus, in this study we investigated the clinical value of follow-up visits for patients with CLL.
   Methods
   We collected data from diagnosis and follow-up visits for patients diagnosed with CLL and managed by WAW in the North Denmark Region between 2007-2014. High-and low-risk group patients were determined by Binet stage, IgVH status, and cytogenetics at diagnosis. The effect of risk group allocation on the probability of receiving CLL-directed treatment within two years was included in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age and blood test results.
   Results
   273 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 3 years (IQR: 1.6-5.4). Overall, the median interval between follow-up visits was 98 days (95% CI: 96-100) (high-risk patients: 91 days [ 95% CI: 86-95] vs. low-risk patients: 105 days [ 95% CI: 100-110]). Among 2,312 follow-up visits, only 387 (17%) were associated with interventions. At the following time points: 6 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years, patients with low-risk CLL had significantly lower odds of initiating treatment compared to patients with high-risk CLL.
   Conclusion
   WAWplays an important role in managing CLL. Interventions at follow-up visits were infrequent and low-risk patients had significantly lower risk of treatment initiation. We question the value of routine follow-up in CLL in the absence of changes in symptoms and/or blood test results.

TI Conformity in numbers-Does criticality in social responses exist?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MAJORITY-RULE; MODEL; INDEPENDENCE; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS
AB Within this paper we explore the idea of a critical value representing the proportion of majority members within a group that affects dramatic changes in influence targets' conformity. We consider the threshold q-voter model when the responses of the Willis-Nail model, a well-established two-dimensional model of social response, are used as a foundation. Specifically, we study a generalized threshold q-voter model when all basic types of social response described by Willis-Nail model are considered, i.e. conformity, anticonformity, independence, and uniformity/congruence. These responses occur in our model with complementary probabilities. We introduce independently two thresholds: one needed for conformity, as well as a second one for anticonformity. In the case of conformity, at least r individuals among q neighbors have to share the same opinion in order to persuade a voter to follow majority's opinion, whereas in the case of anticonformity, at least w individuals among q neighbors have to share the same opinion in order to influence voters to take an opinion that goes against that of their own reference group. We solve the model on a complete graph and show that the threshold for conformity significantly influences the results. For example, there is a critical threshold for conformity above which the system behaves as in the case of unanimity, i.e. displays continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. On the other hand, the threshold for anticonformity is almost irrelevant. We discuss our results from the perspective of theories of social psychology, as well as the philosophy of agent-based modeling.

ID HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; GENDER
AB Cycling is a sport which requires great physical effort from athletes. The stress and anxiety of competition might interfere greatly with performance, by impacting the autonomic system. Physiological alterations, such as situations that irritate, frighten or excite the individual can cause a stress response, defined as a response of the organism to reestablish the homeostasis, regardless of its relationship to a sports situation. The aim of this study was to present data on the autonomic changes induced by precompetitive stress in cyclists and their relation with physical fitness and anxiety. Twelve healthy cyclists aged between 18 and 40 years, with previous experience in competition at the regional level, participated in the study. Heart rate variability (HRV) and physical fitness (body mass index, body fat and aerobic capacity) were measured 5 days before the Mountain Bike championship and remeasured 45 minutes before the start of the race (HRV and Anciety). Paired T test, effect size and correlational test were used. Cycling competition is a stressful situation capable of altering autonomic and hemodynamic parameters. We observed the increase in SDNN, reflecting an increase in sympathetic autonomic control. There were correlations between physical fitness with some autonomic parameters, while anxiety correlated with the years of experience in competition.

   early infant diagnosis
SO PLOS ONE

   MOTHERS; CLINICS; AFRICA; ASSAYS; RISK
AB Background
   Access to point-of-care HIV testing shortens turn-around times, time to diagnosis and reduces loss to follow-up hence minimizing barriers to early linkage to care and treatment among HIV infected infants. Currently samples for early infant HIV diagnosis are sent to centralized testing facilities which are few and located only at specific regions in Kenya. However, there are Point of Care (POC) early infant diagnosis [EID] technologies elsewhere such as SAMBA and ALERE-Q that are yet to be evaluated in Kenya despite the urgent need for data to inform policy formulation regarding EID. The Cepheid GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual (GeneXpert) technology for POC EID offers a great opportunity to minimize HIV associated morbidity, mortality and loss to follow-up through decentralization of early infant HIV testing to the clinics. This technology also allows for same-day results thus facilitating prompt linkage to care.
   Methods
   We evaluated the GeneXpert HIV Qual EID POC in Homabay County against the standard of care platform, Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 qualitative PCR, using dried blood spots (DBS). Between February-July 2016, DBS samples were collected from HIV exposed children <18 months of age enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Samples were collected by qualified nurse counselors, and were tested by trained technicians using field based GeneXpert and conventional laboratory based Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 qualitative PCR. Sensitivity and specificity were determined.
   Results Overall, 3,814 mother/infant pairs were included in the study, out of which 921 infants were HIV exposed as per the mothers' HIV status and based on the infant's HIV rapid test. A total of 969 PCR tests were performed, out of which 30 (3.3%) infants were concordantly positive using both platforms. GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual yielded a sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 99.8% with an overall error rate of 0.7%.
   Conclusion
   Our findings show that GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual performs well compared to CAP/CTM using DBS samples, suggesting that this technology may be adopted in decentralized laboratories as a near POC device. It may contribute to prompt diagnosis of HIV exposed infants hence enabling early linkage to care, thus advancing further gains in EID.

AB Access to validated stimuli depicting children's facial expressions is useful for different research domains (e.g., developmental, cognitive or social psychology). Yet, such databases are scarce in comparison to others portraying adult models, and validation procedures are typically restricted to emotional recognition accuracy. This work presents subjective ratings for a sub-set of 283 photographs selected from the Child Affective Facial Expression set (CAFE [1]). Extending beyond the original emotion recognition accuracy norms [2], our main goal was to validate this database across eight subjective dimensions related to the model (e.g., attractiveness, familiarity) or the specific facial expression (e.g., intensity, genuineness), using a sample from a different nationality (N = 450 Portuguese participants). We also assessed emotion recognition (forced-choice task with seven options: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral). Overall results show that most photographs were rated as highly clear, genuine and intense facial expressions. The models were rated as both moderately familiar and likely to belong to the in-group, obtaining high attractiveness and arousal ratings. Results also showed that, similarly to the original study, the facial expressions were accurately recognized. Normative and raw data are available as supplementary material at https://osf.io/mjqfx/.

TI Protecting endemic species from African Catfish invasion when community

SO PLOS ONE

AB Exotic invasive fish species, when introduced into pristine natural environments, threaten the survival of many endemic species. Management challenges associated with controlling their further spread and protecting endemic species can be exacerbated when the same exotic fish species also provide gastronomical benefits to humans. Local human populations can switch their consumption preferences toward the exotic fish species, leading to an increase in their spread rate and control costs. Using the example of the African Catfish invasion in a freshwater lake, we develop a bioeconomic model of its optimal control, which also incorporates the behavioral challenges arising from a gastronomical preference for the exotic fish species. In particular, the cost of catfish control increases with its consumption demand, which, through altering the inter-species dynamics, threatens the survival of endemic fish species. The manager has at his disposal the market and non-market values of the endemic fish species to invest toward their preservation efforts. The non-market value of the endemic species is further modeled as endogenous to the community's preference switching. Results suggest that a late detection of the exotic fish species in freshwater bodies can increase their control costs enough to make their eradication challenging, especially when the manager faces financial resource constraints. The presence of behavioral effects adds to this challenge-directly, through increasing the control costs, and indirectly, through lowering the non-market value of the endemic fish species.

AB Introduction
   Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is an emerging technique promising an expansion of the donor pool and improvements in the outcome after lung transplantation. Reliable biomarkers for local assessment of organ function in the EVLP system are intensely sought after. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of multiparametric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an EVLP system in a porcine aspiration model.
   Material and methods
   Seven female pigs were anesthetized and gastric juice was instilled in the right lower lobe bronchus to simulate aspiration. Left lungs served as control. Lungs were removed and installed in a modified EVLP system. In the 12-hour EVLP run three sequential MRI scans were performed. Oxygen-washout time, Fourier Decomposition derived ventilation and perfusion, and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging derived perfusion were calculated. P-aO2: F-iO2 ratio was determined and correlated. End-point histology and computed tomography served as control.
   Results
   All animals completed the protocol. MRI structural images showed infiltrates in lungs after aspiration comparable to CT scans. Ventilation was significantly (p = 0.016) reduced while perfusion was increased (p = 0.016) in lungs after aspiration. Non-contrast dependent Fourier decomposition perfusion showed good correlation (R-2 = 0.67) to dynamic contrast enhanced derived perfusion. Oxygen washout time was significantly increased (p = 0.016) in lungs after aspiration and showed a correlation with the P-aO2:F-iO2 ratio (R-2 = 0.54).
   Conclusion
   Multiparametric fMRI for local assessment of organ function is feasible in EVLP and detects alterations in lung function following aspiration with correlation to clinical parameters. fMRI may improve organ assessment in ex-vivo perfusion systems, leading to a better selection of segments suitable for transplant.

TI Optimising the short and long-term clinical outcomes for koalas
   (Phascolarctos cinereus) during treatment for chlamydial infection and
   disease
SO PLOS ONE

AB Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) have suffered severe declines in the northern extent of their range due to a variety of threats, including habitat destruction, trauma from cars and dogs, climate change and importantly, disease. The most significant pathogen in koalas is Chlamydia pecorum, which causes inflammation and fibrosis at mucosal sites, resulting in blindness, infertility and death in severe cases. Chlamydia treatment can be problematic in koalas as the response to treatment is often poor in chronic cases and antimicrobial choice is limited. Thus, chlamydial disease is a severely threatening process for koala conservation. We investigated the short and long-term clinical outcomes for 167 koalas with Chlamydia that underwent capture, telemetric monitoring and intensive veterinary management as part of a large-scale population management program in South East Queensland. Chlamydia treatments included the standard regimen of daily subcutaneous chloramphenicol injections (60mg/kg) for 14 to 28-days, and a variety of non-standard regimens such as topical antimicrobials only (for ocular disease), surgical treatment only (for bilateral reproductive tract disease), and other antimicrobials/treatment lengths. To assess these regimens we analysed clinical records, field monitoring data and swab samples collected from the urogenital tract and ocular conjunctiva. Overall, in contrast to other studies, treatment was generally successful with 86.3% of treated koalas released back into the wild. The success of treatment rose to 94.8% however, when the standard treatment regimen was employed. Further, 100% of koalas that were also treated with surgical ovariohysterectomy (n = 12) remained healthy for a median of 466 days of post-treatment monitoring, demonstrating the benefits of surgical treatment. Previous studies reported 45-day chloramphenicol regimens, but the shorter standard regimen still achieved microbiological cure and reduces the risk of negative sequelae associated with treatment and/or captivity and treatment costs. Despite these positive clinical outcomes, alternatives to chloramphenicol are warranted due to its decreasing availability.

   SUBSETS
AB Sodium chloride promotes vascular fibrosis, arterial hypertension, pro-inflammatory immune cell polarization and endothelial dysfunction, all of which might influence outcomes following stroke. But despite enormous translational relevance, the functional importance of sodium chloride in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke is still unclear. In the current study, we show that high-salt diet leads to significantly worse functional outcomes, increased infarct volumes, and a loss of astrocytes and cortical neurons in acute ischemic stroke. While analyzing the underlying pathologic processes, we identified the migrasome as a novel, sodium chloride-driven pathomechanism in acute ischemic stroke. The migrasome was previously described in vitro as a migrating organelle, which incorporates and dispatches cytosol of surrounding cells and plays a role in intercellular signaling, whereas a pathophysiological meaning has not been elaborated. We here confirm previously reported characteristics of the migrasome in vivo. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and proteomic analyses further demonstrate that the migrasome incorporates and dispatches cytosol of surrounding neurons following stroke. The clinical relevance of these findings is emphasized by neuropathological examinations, which detected migrasome formation in infarcted brain parenchyma of human stroke patients. In summary, we demonstrate that high-salt diet aggravates stroke outcomes, and we characterize the migrasome as a novel mechanism in acute stroke pathophysiology.

   NONINVASIVE TECHNIQUE; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES
AB Background
   The Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) is an emerging laboratory model of type 2 diabetes. When fed standard rodent chow, the majority of males progress from hyperinsulinemia by 2 months to hyperglycemia by 6 months, while most females remain at the hyperinsulinemia-only stage (prediabetic) from 2 months onward. Since diabetic cardiomyopathy is the major cause of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related mortality, we examined whether sexual dimorphism might entail cardiac functional changes. Our ultimate goal was to isolate the effect of diet as a modifiable lifestyle factor.
   Materials and methods
   Nile rats were fed either standard rodent chow (Chow group) or a high-fiber diet previously established to prevent type 2 diabetes (Fiber group). Cardiac function was determined with echocardiography at 12 months of age. To isolate the effect of diet alone, only the small subset of animals resistant to both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia were included in this study.
   Results
   In males, Chow (compared to Fiber) was associated with elevated heart rate and mitral E/A velocity ratio, and with lower e'-wave velocity, isovolumetric relaxation time, and ejection time. Of note, these clinically atypical types of diastolic dysfunction occurred independently of body weight. In contrast, females did not exhibit changes in cardiovascular function between diets.
   Conclusions
   The higher prevalence of T2DM in males correlates with their susceptibility to develop subtle diastolic cardiac dysfunction when fed a Western style diet (throughout most of their life-span) despite no systemic evidence of metabolic syndrome, let alone T2DM.

ID CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; METAANALYSIS; DISPARITIES; RISK; US
AB Recent tobacco taxation research suggests that excise tax structure plays an important role in the effectiveness of increasing taxes in reducing consumption. However, evidence on excise tax structures of alcoholic beverages is scarce. We linked price variability measures for beer, wine, and liquor in the US derived using Economist Intelligence Unit city data from 2003 to 2016 with state-level excise tax structures from the Alcohol Policy Information System. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were performed to assess the associations between excise tax structures and price variability, for beer, wine, and liquor (spirits), respectively. Results suggest that, compared with a specific excise beer tax structure based on volumes, a mixed structure with both specific and ad valorem components was associated with 38% (p <= 0.01) greater beer price variability. In addition, a mixed excise tax structure for liquor was associated with 60-77% (p <= 0.01) greater liquor price variability. However, these associations do not imply a causal link between tax structures and price variability. In summary, a mixed excise tax structure is associated with greater variability in beer and liquor prices, an indicator for tax avoidance opportunities. Future research is needed to identify the causal impact of tax structures on price variability.

AB To reverse the effects of deforestation, tropical areas have expanded restoration efforts in recent years. As ecological restoration positively affects the structure and function of degraded ecosystems, understanding to what extent restoration recovers ecosystem services (ES) is an important step in directing large-scale restoration actions. We evaluated the effect of restoration in increasing the provision of ES in tropical forests. We performed a global meta-analysis of ecological indicators of the ES provided in restored areas, degraded areas and reference ecosystems. We tested for the effects of different restoration strategies, different types of degradation and for the effects of restoration over time. Overall, restoration actions contributed to a significant increase in levels of ecological indicators of ES (carbon pool, soil attributes and biodiversity protection) compared to disturbed areas. Among the restoration strategies, the natural regeneration was the most effective. Biodiversity protection and carbon recovered better than soil attributes. All other restoration strategies recovered ES to a substantially lesser degree, and reforestation with exotics decreased the ES of areas degraded by agriculture. In areas degraded by pasture, restoration was more effective in recovering the biodiversity protection, whereas in areas degraded by agriculture, the restoration recovered mainly the carbon pool. Our results show that by choosing the correct strategy, restoration can recover much of the ES lost by the degradation of tropical forests. These results should be considered for large-scale conservation and management efforts for this biome.

TI Assessment of prenatal cerebral and cardiac metabolic changes in a

AB Background
   We have used a previously reported rabbit model of fetal growth restriction (FGR), reproducing perinatal neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular impairments, to investigate the main relative changes in cerebral and cardiac metabolism of term FGR fetuses during nutrient infusion.
   Methods
   FGR was induced in 9 pregnant New Zealand rabbits at 25 days of gestation: one horn used as FGR, by partial ligation of uteroplacental vessels, and the contralateral as control (appropriate for gestation age, AGA). At 30 days of gestation, fasted mothers under anesthesia were infused i.v. with 1-C-13-glucose (4 mothers), 2-C-13-acetate (3 mothers), or not infused (2 mothers). Fetal brain and heart samples were quickly harvested and frozen down. Brain cortex and heart apex regions from 30 fetuses were studied ex vivo by HRMAS at 4 degrees C, acquiring multinuclear 1D and 2D spectra. The data were processed, quantified by peak deconvolution or integration, and normalized to sample weight.
   Results
   Most of the total C-13-labeling reaching the fetal brains/hearts (80-90%) was incorporated to alanine and lactate (cytosol), and to the glutamine-glutamate pool (mitochondria). Acetate-derived lactate (Lac C2C3) had a slower turnover in FGR brains (similar to-20%). In FGR hearts, mitochondrial turnover of acetate-derived glutamine (Gln C4) was slower (-23%) and there was a stronger accumulation of phospholipid breakdown products (glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine, +50%), resembling the profile of non-infused control hearts.
   Conclusions
   Our results indicate specific functional changes in cerebral and cardiac metabolism of FGR fetuses under nutrient infusion, suggesting glial impairment and restricted mitochondrial metabolism concomitant with slower cell membrane turnover in cardiomyocytes, respectively. These prenatal metabolic changes underlie neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular problems observed in this FGR model and in clinical patients, paving the way for future studies aimed at evaluating metabolic function postnatally and in response to stress and/or treatment.

TI Disease vocabulary size as a surrogate marker for physicians' disease
   knowledge volume
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective
   Recognizing what physicians know and do not know about a particular disease is one of the keys to designing clinical decision support systems, since these systems can fulfill complementary role by recognizing this boundary. To our knowledge, however, no study has attempted to quantify how many diseases physicians actually know and thus the boundary is unclear. This study explores a method to solve this problem by investigating whether the vocabulary assessment techniques developed in the linguistics field can be applied to assess physicians' knowledge.
   Methods
   The test design required us to pay special attention to disease knowledge assessment. First, to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on the physicians, we chose a self-assessment questionnaire that was straightforward to fill out. Second, to prevent overestimation, we used a "pseudo-word" approach: fictitious diseases were included in the questionnaire, and positive responses to them were penalized. Third, we used paper-based tests, rather than computer-based ones, to further prevent participants from cheating by using a search engine. Fourth, we selectively used borderline diseases, i.e., diseases that physicians might or might not know about, rather than well-known or little-known diseases, in the questionnaire.
   Results
   We collected 102 valid answers from 109 physicians who attended the seminars we conducted. On the basis of these answers, we estimated that the average physician knew of 2008 diseases (95% confidence interval: (1939, 2071)). This preliminary estimation agrees with the guideline for the national license examination in Japan, suggesting that this vocabulary assessment was able to evaluate physicians' knowledge. The survey included physicians with various backgrounds, but there were no significant differences between subgroups. Other implication for researches on clinical decision support and limitation of the sampling method adopted in this study are also discussed, toward more rigorous estimation in future surveys.

AB Plants interact with a wide variety of fungi in a mutualistic, parasitic or neutral way. The associations formed depend on the exchange of nutrients and signalling molecules between the partners. This includes a diverse set of protein classes involved in defence, nutrient uptake or establishing a symbiotic relationship. Here, we have analysed the secretomes of the mutualistic, root-endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica and Arabidopsis thaliana when cultivated alone or in a co-culture. More than one hundred proteins were identified as differentially secreted, including proteins associated with growth, development, abiotic and biotic stress response and mucilage. While some of the proteins have been associated before to be involved in plant-microbial interaction, other proteins are newly described in this context. One plant protein found in the co-culture is PLAT1 (Polycystin, Lipoxygenase, Alpha-toxin and Triacylglycerol lipase). PLAT1 has not been associated with plant-fungal-interaction and is known to play a role in abiotic stress responses. In colonised roots PLAT1 shows an altered gene expression in a stage specific manner and plat1 knock-out plants are colonised stronger. It co-localises with Brassicaceae-specific endoplasmic reticulum bodies (ER-bodies) which are involved in the formation of the defence compound scopolin. We observed degraded ER-bodies in infected Arabidopsis roots and a change in the scopolin level in response to the presence of the fungus.

TI Transcriptomic and proteomic host response to Aspergillus fumigatus
   conidia in an air-liquid interface model of human bronchial epithelium

AB Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is a wide-spread fungus that is a potent allergen in hypersensitive individuals but also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. It reproduces asexually by releasing airborne conidiospores (conidia). Upon inhalation, fungal conidia are capable of reaching the airway epithelial cells (AECs) in bronchial and alveolar tissues. Previous studies have predominantly used submerged monolayer cultures for studying this host-pathogen interaction; however, these cultures do not recapitulate the mucocililary differentiation phenotype of the in vivo epithelium in the respiratory tract. Thus, the aim of this study was to use well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) grown at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to determine their transcriptomic and proteomic responses following interaction with A. fumigatus conidia. We visualized conidial interaction with HBECs using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and applied NanoString nCounter and shotgun proteomics to assess gene expression changes in the human cells upon interaction with A. fumigatus conidia. Western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of top three differentially expressed proteins, CALR, SET and NUCB2. CLSM showed that, unlike submerged monolayer cultures, well-differentiated ALI cultures of primary HBECs were estimated to internalize less than 1% of bound conidia. Nevertheless, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed numerous differentially expressed host genes; these were enriched for pathways including apoptosis/autophagy, translation, unfolded protein response and cell cycle (up-regulated); complement and coagulation pathways, iron homeostasis, nonsense mediated decay and rRNA binding (down-regulated). CALR and SET were confirmed to be up-regulated in ALI cultures of primary HBECs upon exposure to A. fumigatus via western blot analysis. Therefore, using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, ALI models recapitulating the bronchial epithelial barrier in the conductive zone of the respiratory tract can provide novel insights to the molecular response of bronchial epithelial cells upon exposure to A. fumigatus conidia.

AB Fanconi anemia is a rare genome instability disorder with extreme susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and anogenital tract. In patients with this inherited disorder, the risk of head and neck cancer is 800-fold higher than in the general population, a finding which might suggest a viral etiology. Here, we analyzed the possible contribution of human polyomaviruses to FA-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by a pan-polyomavirus immunohistochemistry test which detects the T antigens of all known human polyomaviruses. We observed weak reactivity in 17% of the HNSCC samples suggesting that based on classical criteria, human polyomaviruses are not causally related to squamous cell carcinomas analyzed in this study.

AB Though many European Upper Palaeolithic sites document early examples of symbolic material expressions (e.g., cave art, personal ornaments, figurines), there exist few reports on the use of earth pigments outside of cave art-and occasionally Neanderthal-contexts. Here, we present the first in-depth study of the diachronic changes in ochre use throughout an entire Upper Palaeolithic sequence at Hohle Fels cave, Germany, spanning from ca. 44,000-14,500 cal. yr. BP. A reassessment of the assemblage has yielded 869 individual ochre artefacts, of which 27 show traces of anthropogenic modification. The ochre artefacts are from all Upper Palaeolithic layers, stemming from the earliest Aurignacian horizons to the Holocene. This wide temporal spread demonstrates the long-term presence and continuity of ochre use in a part of Europe where it has not been systematically reported before. The anthropogenic modifications present on the ochre artefacts from the Gravettian and Magdalenian are consistent with pigment powder production, whereas the only modified piece from the Aurignacian displays a possible engraved motif. The non-modified artefacts show that more hematite-rich specular ochres as well as fine-grained deep red iron oxide clays were preferred during the Gravettian and Magdalenian, while the Aurignacian layers contain a broader array of colours and textures. Furthermore, numerous other artefacts such as faunal elements, personal ornaments, shells, and an ochre grindstone further strengthen the conclusion that ochre behaviours were well established during the onset of the Aurignacian and subsequently flourished throughout the Upper Palaeolithic at Hohle Fels cave.

TI Change in kidney volume after kidney transplantation in patients with
   autosomal polycystic kidney disease
SO PLOS ONE

   PROGRESSION; BIOMARKER; ADPKD; MRI
AB Background
   The indication to bilateral nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney scheduled for kidney transplantation is controversial. Indeed, the progressive enlargement of cysts may increase the risk of complications and the need for nephrectomy. However, very few studies investigated the change in kidney volume after kidney transplantation.
   Material and methods
   In this prospective cohort study, the change in native kidney volume in polycystic patients was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. Forty patients were included in the study. Kidney diameters and total kidney volume were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging in patients who underwent simultaneous nephrectomy and kidney transplantation and in patients with kidney transplant alone, before transplantation and 1 year after transplantation.
   Results
   There was a significant reduction of kidney volume after transplantation, with a mean degree of kidney diameters reduction varying from 12.24% to 14.43%. Mean total kidney volume of the 55 kidney considered in the analysis significantly reduced from 1617.94 +/- 833.42 ml to 1381.42 +/- 1005.73 ml (P<0.05), with a mean rate of 16.44% of volume decrease. More than 80% of patients had a volume reduction in both groups.
   Conclusions
   Polycystic kidneys volume significantly reduces after kidney transplantation, and this would reduce the need for prophylactic bilateral nephrectomy in asymptomatic patients.

AB The ability of Trichoderma harzianum (strain OMG-08) as plant growth promoting fungus (PGPF), was tested on Zea mays plants grown in soil pots added with different inorganic (triple superphosphate and rock phosphate) and organic (cow and horse manure composts) P fertilizers. The effect of treatments was evaluated by following the variations of plants dry biomass and nutrient content, as well as the metabolic changes in plant leaves by both GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. A synergic effect was observed in treatments with both composts and fungus inoculation, in which not only plant growth and P uptake were enhanced, but also the expression of different metabolites related to an improved photosynthetic activity. Conversely, the combination of Trichoderma with inorganic fertilizers was less effective and even showed a reduction of plants shoot biomass and N content. The corresponding plant metabolome revealed metabolic compounds typical of biotic or abiotic stresses, which may be attributed to a reduced capacity of inorganic fertilizers to provide a sufficient P availability during plant growth. Our findings also indicate that the molecular composition of compost differentiated the Trichoderma activity in sustaining plant growth. The positive effects of the combined Trichoderma and compost treatment suggest that it may become an alternative to the phosphorus mineral fertilization.

AB Obesity and diabetes increase the risk of depression, and the incidence of these conditions increases rapidly after menopause, but few animal models of postmenopausal obesity have been available. We developed a mouse model of postmenopausal obesity that exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in behavioral tests. To examine the effect of estradiol (E2) in the model, we prepared 4 experimental groups: 1) control, sham-operated female C57BL/6 mice fed a regular diet; 2) OVX-HF, ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a high-fat diet (HF); 3) E2-SC, OVX-HF mice administered subcutaneous (SC) E2 (50 mu g/kg/day); and 4) E2-ICV, OVX-HF mice administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) E2 (1 mu g/kg/day). OVX-HF mice exhibited anxiety phenotypes in the open field test, but not in the light-dark box test, and E2 treatment via both routes effectively ameliorated it. OVX-HF mice demonstrated depressive phenotypes in the tail suspension test and forced swim test. Both E2 treatments achieved significant improvement in the tail suspension test, but not in the forced swim test. Serum corticosterone levels did not differ among the groups. Hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and serotonin 1A receptor mRNA was significantly increased in OVX-HF mice and was decreased in E2-treated mice. The hypothalamic level of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) protein was tended to decrease in OVX-HF mice, but neither E2 treatment increased it. Since this mouse model exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in relatively short experimental periods without genetic manipulations, it would be useful for further exploring psychiatric phenotypes or screening of therapeutic candidates in postmenopausal obesity.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the interrelationship between tooth preparation and dental structure of Chinese maxillary central incisors and provide scientific guidance for clinical all-ceramic restoration. Forty-five specimens of maxillary central incisors were fabricated by 3D printer based on data of Micro CT scanning. Subsequently, every three specimens from the same natural tooth were randomly divided into three groups (n = 15): porcelain veneer, all ceramic crown, and the blank control group. All the specimen teeth were prepared according to routine clinical criteria, reconstructed into 3D models and then measured in software. The results showed that the mean quantity of reduction (volume fraction) was (28.35 +/- 4.37)% and (56.93 +/- 3.47)% for porcelain veneer and all-ceramic crown, respectively. The bonding areas of different all-ceramic restorations were (128.85 +/- 11.73) mm(2) and (97.15 +/- 9.98) mm(2) for all-ceramic crown and porcelain veneer respectively. In porcelain veneer group, the area of enamel adhesive was (54.80 +/- 12.70) mm(2), and the area of dentin was (42.35 +/- 9.62) mm(2). As the results of the one-sample t test, the mean distances from medullary angle to incisal edge or adjacent surface have significant differences with the test value which was set as 0.5 (P<.05). The reduction of the tooth for porcelain veneer is less than that of ceramic crown and the cementation of porcelain veneer is mostly dependent on the conservation of the enamel during preparation. The region from mesial adjacent surface to mesiopulpal angle is prone to have the problem of medullary perforation.

TI Intracellular redistribution of neuronal peroxisomes in response to

SO PLOS ONE

   TETHER; MIRO1; VAPS; ER
AB Peroxisomes can be frequently found in proximity to other subcellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria or lysosomes. The tail-anchored protein ACBD5 was recently identified as part of a tethering complex at peroxisome-ER contact sites, interacting with the ER resident protein VAPB. Contact site disruption was found to significantly increase peroxisome motility, apparently interfering with intracellular positioning systems. Unlike other somatic cells, neurons have to distribute organelles across relatively long distances in order to maintain their extraordinary cellular polarity. Using confocal live imaging microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons we observed that peroxisomes and mitochondria show a strikingly similar motility with approximately 10% performing microtubule-driven long range movements. In order to investigate if ER contacts influence overall peroxisome motility and cellular distribution patterns, hippocampal neurons were transfected with plasmids encoding ACBD5 to stimulate peroxisome-ER interactions. Overexpression of ACBD5 reduced peroxisomal long range movements in the neurites of the hippocampal cells by 70%, implying that ER attachment counteracts microtubule-driven peroxisome transport, while mitochondrial motility was unaffected. Moreover, the analyses of peroxisome distribution in fixed neurons unveiled a significant redistribution of peroxisomes towards the periphery of the perikaryon underneath the plasma membrane and into neurites, where peroxisomes are frequently found in close proximity to mitochondria. Surprisingly, further analysis of peroxisome and VAPB distribution upon ACBD5 expression did not reveal a substantial colocalization, implying this effect may be independent of VAPB. In line with these findings, expression of an ACBD5 variant unable to bind to VAPB still altered the localization of peroxisomes in the same way as the wild-type ACBD5. Thus, we conclude, that the VAPB-ACBD5 facilitated peroxisome-ER interaction is not responsible for the observed organelle redistribution in neurons. Rather, we suggest that additional ACBD5-binding proteins in neurons may tether peroxisomes to contact sites at or near the plasma membrane of neurons.

   INFECTION; SUPPLEMENTATION
AB Background
   While a number of predictors for Ebola mortality have been identified, less is known about post-viral symptoms. The identification of acute-illness predictors for post-viral symptoms could allow the selection of patients for more active follow up in the future, and those in whom early interventions may be beneficial in the long term. Studying predictors of both mortality and post-viral symptoms within a single cohort of patients could also further our understanding of the pathophysiology of survivor sequelae.
   Methods/Principal findings
   We performed a historical cohort study using data collected as part of routine clinical care from an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, in order to identify predictors of mortality and of post-viral symptoms. Variables included as potential predictors were sex, age, date of admission, first recorded viral load at the ETC and symptoms (recorded upon presentation at the ETC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors. Of 263 Ebola-confirmed patients admitted between November 2014 and March 2015, 151 (57%) survived to ETC discharge. Viral load was the strongest predictor of mortality (adjusted OR comparing high with low viral load: 84.97, 95% CI 30.87-345.94). We did not find evidence that a high viral load predicted post-viral symptoms (ocular: 1.17, 95% CI 0.35-3.97; musculoskeletal: 1.07, 95% CI 0.28-4.08). Ocular post-viral symptoms were more common in females (2.31, 95% CI 0.98-5.43) and in those who had experienced hiccups during the acute phase (4.73, 95% CI 0.90-24.73).
   Conclusions/Significance
   These findings may add epidemiological support to the hypothesis that post-viral symptoms have an immune-mediated aspect and may not only be a consequence of high viral load and disease severity.

AB Background
   The chronic remitting and relapsing intestinal inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease frequently leads to fibrosis and subsequent stenosis of the inflamed region. Approximately a third of all Crohn's disease patients require resection at some stage in their disease course. As the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease associated fibrosis is largely unknown, a strong necessity exists to better understand the pathophysiology thereof.
   Methods
   In this study, we investigated changes of the DNA methylome and transcriptome of ileum-derived fibroblasts associated to the occurrence of Crohn's disease associated fibrosis. Eighteen samples were included in a DNA methylation array and twenty-one samples were used for RNA sequencing.
   Results
   Most differentially methylated regions and differentially expressed genes were observed when comparing stenotic with non-inflamed samples. By contrast, few differences were observed when comparing Crohn's disease with non-Crohn's disease, or inflamed with non-inflamed tissue. Integrative methylation and gene expression analyses revealed dysregulation of genes associated to the PRKACA and E2F1 network, which is involved in cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and bile metabolism.

ID PRETERM BIRTH; ELEMENTS; EVOLUTION; SUBJECT; AGE
AB Placental dysfunction is implicated in many pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm birth (PTB). While both these syndromes are influenced by environmental risk factors, they also have a substantial genetic component that is not well understood. Precisely controlled gene expression during development is crucial to proper placental function and often mediated through gene regulatory enhancers. However, we lack accurate maps of placental enhancer activity due to the challenges of assaying the placenta and the difficulty of comprehensively identifying enhancers. To address the gap in our knowledge of gene regulatory elements in the placenta, we used a two-step machine learning pipeline to synthesize existing functional genomics studies, transcription factor (TF) binding patterns, and evolutionary information to predict placental enhancers. The trained classifiers accurately distinguish enhancers from the genomic background and placental enhancers from enhancers active in other tissues. Genomic features collected from tissues and cell lines involved in pregnancy are the most predictive of placental regulatory activity. Applying the classifiers genome-wide enabled us to create a map of 33,010 predicted placental enhancers, including 4,562 high-confidence enhancer predictions. The genome-wide placental enhancers are significantly enriched nearby genes associated with placental development and birth disorders and for SNPs associated with gestational age. These genome-wide predicted placental enhancers provide candidate regions for further testing in vitro, will assist in guiding future studies of genetic associations with pregnancy phenotypes, and aid interpretation of potential mechanisms of action for variants found through genetic studies.

AB Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes are frequently associated. Using echocardiography, we know that tissue Doppler imaging E/e' ratio is a reliable predictor of left ventricular filling pressure. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the averaged E/e' ratio value in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic controls. In the analysis we included cross-sectional studies providing the averaged E/e' ratio. Subgroup/sensitivity analyses were conducted according to variables known to influence E/e' ratio measurements. The analysis included 15 cross sectional studies with 877 type 2 diabetes patients and 1193 controls. The weighted mean difference showed higher values in diabetes (WMD 2.02; 95% CI 1.35, 2.70; p<0.001). The result was consistent in the subgroup/sensitivity analyses. Visual inspection of the funnel plot did not identify substantial asymmetry and the Egger test for funnel plot asymmetry showed a p value of 0.36. In conclusion, our assessment suggests that averaged E/e' ratio is consistently increased in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic controls in the absence of cardiovascular diseases and complicated hypertension. This alteration may be a precocious diastolic alteration in the diabetic cardiomyopathy.

   POPULATIONS; MARKERS; REGION
AB Crown rust disease caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) is a major production constraint of oat in North America, Europe, and Australia. There are over 100 genes effective against one or more Pca races, but only a handful of seedling resistance (Pc) genes have been mapped to a known chromosomal location. The goal of the present study was to use linkage mapping to identify the genomic location of the Pc53 gene, and to produce a list of linked SNPs with potential as molecular markers for marker assisted breeding. The Pc53 gene was placed on the linkage group Mrg08 at 82.4 cM using F5-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between the Pc53 carrier 6-112-1-15 (PI 311624) and the susceptible cultivar Otana. The map location was validated using RILs from a cross between 6-112-1-15 and the Pc50 differential line. Single nucleotide polymorphism marker GMI_ES02_c14533_567 was the closest to Pc53. A major seedling resistance gene 'PcKM' and QTL QcC.Core.08.1, QCr.Core.08.2, QCr.Core.08.3 and QCr.cdl9-12D were previously reported on Mrg08. QPc.Core.08.1 and PcKM were mapped to within 1 cM of Pc53; but previous virulence studies have indicated separate identities. The chromosomal location of Pc53 and SNPs linked with it will facilitate the utilization of Pc53 in oat breeding programs.

AB The purpose of this study was to clarify the genetic diversity of Phytopythium helicoides and to understand the transmission mode of the pathogen in Japan. In total, 232 P. helicoides isolates were collected from various host plants and geographic origins, including farms and natural environments. We developed 6 novel microsatellite markers for use in the study and found 90 alleles among the 6 markers in the 232 isolates. The analysis of molecular variance suggested that P. helicoides has high variance within individuals and low fixation indices between populations. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates collected from the same hosts and/or geographic origins were often grouped together. For example, several isolates from natural environments were grouped with isolates from nearby agricultural areas. On the other hand, 2 geographically distant populations collected from the same host plant had similar genotypes. Our results suggested that migration of the pathogen could be facilitated naturally via drainage systems or by human activity in the transport of agricultural materials.

AB Phytotoxic potential of rosmarinic acid (RA), a caffeic acid ester largely found in aromatic species, was evaluated on Arabidopsis through metabolomic and microscopic approaches. In-vitro bioassays pointed out that RA affected root growth and morphology, causing ROS burst, ROS scavengers activity inhibition and consequently, an alteration on cells organization and ultrastructure. In particular, RA-treatment (175 mu M) caused strong vacuolization, alteration of mitochondria structure and function and a consistent ROS-induced reduction of their transmembrane potential (Delta Psi(m)). These data suggested a cell energy deficit also confirmed by the metabolomic analysis, which highlighted a strong alteration of both TCA cycle and amino acids metabolism. Moreover, the increase in H2O2 and O-2(-) contents suggested that RA-treated meristems underwent oxidative stress, resulting in apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that RA inhibits two of the main ROS scavengers causing high ROS accumulation, responsible of the alterations on mitochondrial ultrastructure and activity through Delta Psi(m) dissipation, TCA-cycle alteration, cell starvation and consequently cell death on Arabidopsis seedlings. All these effects resulted in a strong inhibition on root growth and development, which convert RA in a promising molecule to be explored for further use in weed management.

   PERCEPTIONS; CULTURE; CONTEXT; MODEL
AB It has been shown that people process assortment variety more efficiently in horizontal displays than in vertical displays, owing to human visual characteristics that favor the horizontal direction. Consequently, the number and variety of products chosen tends to increase when they are arranged horizontally. I show that this horizontal display advantage can be modulated by culture, especially writing and reading habits. When Japanese participants, who write and read text vertically as well as horizontally, chose products in horizontal and vertical displays, horizontal displays did not consistently increase the variety of products chosen. In other words, the horizontal display advantage was eliminated (Experiments 1A and 1B). However, when Japanese readers initially read horizontally, it led to a robust advantage for the horizontal display. Similarly, initial vertical reading resulted in a vertical display advantage (Experiments 2 and 3). These results suggest that horizontal displays are not always advantageous, and that optimal display direction for product choice is affected by reading habits.

   STATEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB This study assessed labor and delivery (L&D) unit space and design, and also considered correlations between physical space measurements and clinical outcomes. Design and human factors research has increased standardization in high-hazard industries, but is not fully utilized in medicine. Emergency department and intensive care unit space has been studied, but optimal L&D unit design is undefined. In this prospective, observational study, a multidisciplinary team assessed physical characteristics of ten L&D units. Design measurements were analyzed with California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) data from 34,161 deliveries at these hospitals. The hospitals ranged in delivery volumes (< 1000-> 5000 annual deliveries) and cesarean section rates (19.6%-39.7%). Within and among units there was significant heterogeneity in labor room (LR) and operating room (OR) size, count, and number of configurations. There was significant homogeneity of room equipment. Delivery volumes correlated with unit size, room counts, and cesarean delivery rates. Relative risk of cesarean section was modestly increased when certain variables were above average (delivery volume, unit size, LR count, OR count, OR configuration count, LR to OR distance, unit utilization) or below average (LR size, OR size, LR configuration count). Existing variation suggests a gold standard design has yet to be adopted for L&D. A design-centered approach identified opportunities for standardization: 1) L&D unit size and 2) room counts based on current or projected delivery volume, and 3) LR and OR size and equipment. When combined with further human factors research, these guidelines could help design the L&D unit of the future.

TI High HIV incidence and low uptake of HIV prevention services: The
   context of risk for young male adults prior to DREAMS in rural
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; CARE; MEN
AB Background
   Young men are less likely than young women to engage with HIV prevention and care, and their HIV-related mortality is higher. We describe HIV incidence and uptake of HIV services in men 20-29 years(y) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, before the roll-out of DREAMS.
   Methods
   We used data from a population-based demographic and HIV surveillance cohort. HIV incidence was estimated from anonymised testing in an annual serosurvey. Service uptake was assessed in 2011 and 2015, through two self-reported outcomes: 1) HIV testing in the past 12 months(m); 2) voluntary medical male circumcision(VMMC). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios(OR) and 95% confidence intervals(CI) for factors associated with each outcome.
   Results
   HIV incidence in 2011-2015 was 2.6/100 person-years (95% CI = 2.0-3.4) and 4.2 (95% CI = 3.1-5.6) among men 20-24y and 25-29y, respectively, with no significant change from 2006-2010. N = 1311 and N = 1221 young men participated in the 2011 and 2015 surveys, respectively. In both years, <50% reported testing for HIV in the past 12m. In 2011, only 5% reported VMMC, but coverage in 2015 increased to 40% and 20% in men 20-24y and 25-29y, respectively. HIV testing was positively associated with higher education and mobility. Testing uptake was higher in men reporting >1 partner in the past 12m, or condom use at last sex, but lower in those reporting a casual partner (adjusted (a) OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.37-0.75). VMMC uptake was associated with survey year and higher education. Men aged 25-29y and those who were employed (aOR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.49-0.89) were less likely to report VMMC.
   Conclusions
   HIV incidence in men 20-29y was very high, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be considered in this population. Uptake of services was low. VMMC coverage increased dramatically from 2011 to 2015, especially among younger men, suggesting a demand for this service. Interventions designed with and for young men are urgently needed.

SO PLOS ONE

ID RNA-SEQ; DIVERSITY; MOUSE; CLASSIFICATION; RETENTION; SUITE
AB Transcriptomic profiling of complex tissues by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) affords some advantages over single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). snRNA-seq provides less biased cellular coverage, does not appear to suffer cell isolation-based transcriptional artifacts, and can be applied to archived frozen specimens. We used well-matched snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets from mouse visual cortex to compare cell type detection. Although more transcripts are detected in individual whole cells (similar to 11,000 genes) than nuclei (similar to 7,000 genes), we demonstrate that closely related neuronal cell types can be similarly discriminated with both methods if intronic sequences are included in snRNA-seq analysis. We estimate that the nuclear proportion of total cellular mRNA varies from 20% to over 50% for large and small pyramidal neurons, respectively. Together, these results illustrate the high information content of nuclear RNA for characterization of cellular diversity in brain tissues.

TI Understanding urbanization: A study of census and satellite-derived
   urban classes in the United States, 1990-2010
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID AREAL INTERPOLATION; LAND; SETTLEMENTS; SURFACE
AB Most of future population growth will take place in the world's cities and towns. Yet, there is no well-established, consistent way to measure either urban land or people. Even census-based urban concepts and measures undergo frequent revision, impeding rigorous comparisons over time and place. This study presents a new spatial approach to derive consistent urban proxies for the US. It compares census-designated urban blocks with proxies for land-based classifications of built-up areas derived from time-series of the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) for 1990-2010. This comparison provides a new way to understand urban structure and its changes: Most land that is more than 50% built-up, and people living on such land, are officially classified as urban. However, 30% of the census-designated urban population and land is located in less built-up areas that can be characterized as mainly suburban and peri-urban in nature. Such insights are important starting points for a new urban research program: creating globally and temporally consistent proxies to guide modelling of urban change.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID CURVATURE; HIGHWAY; CRASHES
AB We present the ROCA (ROad Curvature Analyst) software, in the form of an ESRI ArcGIS Toolbox, intended for vector line data processing. The software segments road network data into tangents and horizontal curves. Horizontal curve radii and azimuth of tangents are then automatically computed. Simultaneously, additional frequently used road section characteristics are calculated, such as the sinuosity of a road section (detour ratio), the number of turns along an individual road section and the average cumulative angle for a road section. The identification of curves is based on the naive Bayes classifier and users are allowed to prepare their own training data files. We applied ROCA software to secondary roads within the Czech road network (9,980 km). The data processing took less than ten minutes. Approximately 43% of the road network in question consists of 42,752 horizontal curves. The ROCA software outperforms other existing automatic methods by 26% with respect to the percentage of correctly identified curves. The segmented secondary roads within the Czech road network can be viewed on the roca.cdvgis.cz/czechia web-map application. We combined data on road geometry with road crashes database to develop the crash modification factors for horizontal curves with various radii. We determined that horizontal curves with radii of 50 m are approximately 3.7 times more hazardous than horizontal curves with radii accounting for 1000 m. ROCA software can be freely downloaded for non-commercial use from https://roca.cdvinfo.cz/website.

TI Factors associated with institutional delivery: Findings from a

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DISTRICT; PREGNANCY; EDUCATION; NEPAL
AB In Tanzania, maternal mortality has stagnated over the last 10 years, and some of the areas with the worst indicators are in the Lake and Western Zones. This study investigates the factors associated with institutional deliveries among women aged 15-49 years in two regions of the Lake Zone. Data were extracted from a cross-sectional household survey of 1,214 women aged 15-49 years who had given birth in the 2 years preceding the survey in Mara and Kagera regions. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the influence of various factors on giving birth in a facility. About two-thirds (67.3%) of women gave birth at a health facility. After adjusting for possible confounders, six factors were significantly associated with institutional delivery: region (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54 [0.41-0.71]), number of children (aOR, 95% CI: 0.61 [0.42-0.91]), household wealth index (aOR, 95% CI: 1.47 [1.09-2.27]), four or more antenatal care visits (aOR, 95% CI: 1.97 [1.12-3.47]), knowing three or more pregnancy danger signs (aOR, 95% CI: 1.87 [1.27-2.76]), and number of birth preparations (aOR, 95% CI: 6.09 [3.32-11.18]). Another three factors related to antenatal care were also significant in the bivariate analysis, but these were not significantly associated with place of delivery after adjusting for all variables in an extended multivariable regression model. Giving birth in a health facility was associated both with socio-demographic factors and women's interactions with the health care system during pregnancy. The findings show that national policies and programs promoting institutional delivery in Tanzania should tailor interventions to specific regions and reach out to low-income and high-parity women. Efforts are needed not just to increase the number of antenatal care visits made by pregnant women, but also to improve the quality and content of the interaction between women and service providers.

AB Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus is regularly assessed in patients undergoing major heart surgery (MHS). Despite pre-surgical decontamination attempts, a significant proportion of MHS patients remain colonized by S. aureus at the time of surgery. Nasal sampling can be improved by sampling extra-nasal areas. We evaluated whether processing lower respiratory tract (LRT) secretions enhanced the detection of S. aureus after MHS. Following a standard protocol, nasal swabs and LRT aspirates were obtained from all of the study patients at the time of surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. One swab was used for culture in the microbiology laboratory, and a second swab was used for the Xpert SA Nasal Complete assay. According to our definition of colonization (culture positive and/or PCR positive), 31 of 115 patients (26.9%) were colonized at the time of surgery. Among these, LRT samples only were positive in three patients (2.6% of the whole population and 9.7% of the carriers). The remaining 28 were either positive in the nasal sample or positive in both samples. The yield of the detection of colonization by S. aureus by including also LRT samples in patients undergoing MHS is limited and must be balanced with laboratory workload and demands on laboratory personnel.

AB Histological evidence points to the presence of dopamine (DA) in the cephalic sensory organs of multiple gastropod molluscs, suggesting a possible sensory role for the neurotransmitter. We investigated the sensory function of DA in the nudipleuran Pleurobranchaea californica, in which the central neural correlates of sensation and foraging behavior have been well characterized. Tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity (THli), a signature of the dopamine synthetic pathway, was similar to that found in two other opisthobranchs and two pulmonates previously studied: 1) relatively few (<100) THli neuronal somata were observed in the central ganglia, with those observed found in locations similar to those documented in the other snails but varying in number, and 2) the vast majority of THli somata were located in the peripheral nervous system, were associated with ciliated, putative primary sensory cells, and were highly concentrated in chemotactile sensory organs, giving rise to afferent axons projecting to the central nervous system. We extended these findings by observing that applying a selective D-2/D-3 receptor antagonist to the chemo-and mechanosensory oral veil-tentacle complex of behaving animals significantly delayed feeding behavior in response to an appetitive stimulus. A D-1 blocker had no effect. Recordings of the two major cephalic sensory nerves, the tentacle and large oral veil nerves, in a deganglionated head preparation revealed a decrease of stimulus-evoked activity in the former nerve following application of the same D2/D3 antagonist. Broadly, our results implicate DA in sensation and engender speculation regarding the foraging-based decisions the neurotransmitter may serve in the nervous system of Pleurobranchaea and, by extension, other gastropods.

AB Corynebacterium bovis is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen shown to cause eye and prosthetic joint infections as well as abscesses in humans, mastitis in dairy cattle, and skin disease in laboratory mice and rats. Little is known about the genetic characteristics and genomic diversity of C. bovis because only a single draft genome is available for the species. The overall aim of this study was to sequence and compare the genome of C. bovis isolates obtained from different species, locations, and time points. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted on 20 C. bovis isolates (six human, four bovine, nine mouse and one rat) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and submitted to various comparative analysis tools. Sequencing generated high-quality contigs (over 2.53 Mbp) that were comparable to the only reported assembly using C. bovis DSM 20582(T) (97.8 +/- 0.36% completeness). The number of protein-coding DNA sequences (2,174 +/- 12.4) was similar among all isolates. A Corynebacterium genus neighbor-joining tree was created, which revealed Corynebacterium falsenii as the nearest neighbor to C. bovis (95.87% similarity), although the reciprocal comparison shows Corynebacterium jeikeium as closest neighbor to C. falsenii. Interestingly, the average nucleotide identity demonstrated that the C. bovis isolates clustered by host, with human and bovine isolates clustering together, and the mouse and rat isolates forming a separate group. The average number of genomic islands and putative virulence factors were significantly higher (p<0.001) in the mouse and rat isolates as compared to human/bovine isolates. Corynebacterium bovis' pan-genome contained a total of 3,067 genes of which 1,354 represented core genes. The known core genes of all isolates were primarily related to "metabolism" and "information storage/processing." However, most genes were classified as "function unknown" or "unclassified". Surprisingly, no intact prophages were found in any isolate; however, almost all isolates had at least one complete CRISPR-Cas system.

TI Associations between multimorbidity, all-cause mortality and glycaemia

AB Introduction
   Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health priority worldwide and the majority of people with diabetes live with multimorbidity (MM) (the co-occurrence of. 2 chronic conditions). The aim of this systematic review was to explore the association between MM and all-cause mortality and glycaemic outcomes in people with T2D.
   Methods
   The search strategy centred on: T2D, MM, comorbidity, mortality and glycaemia. Databases searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, The Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS. Restrictions included: English language, quantitative empirical studies. Two reviewers independently carried out: abstract and full text screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal. Disagreements adjudicated by a third reviewer.
   Results
   Of the 4882 papers identified; 41 met inclusion criteria. The outcome was all-cause mortality in 16 studies, glycaemia in 24 studies and both outcomes in one study. There were 28 longitudinal cohort studies and 13 cross-sectional studies, with the number of participants ranging from 96-892,223. Included studies were conducted in high or upper-middle-income countries. Fifteen of 17 studies showed a statistically significant association between increasing MM and higher mortality. Ten of 14 studies showed no significant associations between MM and HbA1c. Four of 14 studies found higher levels of MM associated with higher HbA1c. Increasing MM was significantly associated with hypoglycaemia in 9/10 studies. There was no significant association between MM and fasting glucose (one study). No studies explored effects on glycaemic variability.
   Conclusions
   This review demonstrates that MM in T2D is associated with higher mortality and hypoglycaemia, whilst evidence regarding the association with other measures of glycaemic control is mixed. The current single disease focused approach to management of T2D seems inappropriate. Our findings highlight the need for clinical guidelines to support a holistic approach to the complex care needs of those with T2D and MM, accounting for the various conditions that people with T2D may be living with.

AB Grasp affordances in robotics represent different ways to grasp an object involving a variety of factors from vision to hand control. A model of grasp affordances that is able to scale across different objects, features and domains is needed to provide robots with advanced manipulation skills. The existing frameworks, however, can be difficult to extend towards a more general and domain independent approach. This work is the first step towards a modular implementation of grasp affordances that can be separated into two stages: approach to grasp and grasp execution. In this study, human experiments of approaching to grasp are analysed, and object-independent patterns of motion are defined and modelled analytically from the data. Human subjects performed a specific action (hammering) using objects of different geometry, size and weight. Motion capture data relating the hand-object approach distance was used for the analysis. The results showed that approach to grasp can be structured in four distinct phases that are best represented by non-linear models, independent from the objects being handled. This suggests that approaching to grasp patterns are following an intentionally planned control strategy, rather than implementing a reactive execution.

AB The meromictic Lake Cadagno is characterized by a compact chemocline with high concentrations of anoxygenic phototrophic purple and green sulfur bacteria. However, a complete picture of the bacterial diversity, and in particular of effects of seasonality and compartmentalization is missing. To characterize bacterial communities and elucidate relationships between them and their surrounding environment high-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing was conducted. Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria were the dominant groups in Lake Cadagno water column. Moreover, bacterial interaction within the chemocline and between oxic and anoxic lake compartments were investigated through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry (FCM). The different populations of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) and green sulfur bacteria (GSB) in the chemocline indicate seasonal dynamics of phototrophic sulfur bacteria composition. Interestingly, an exceptional bloom of a cyanobacteria population in the oxic-anoxic transition zone affected the common spatial distribution of phototrophic sulfur bacteria with consequence on chemocline location and water column stability. Our study suggests that both bacterial interactions between different lake compartments and within the chemocline can be a dynamic process influencing the stratification structure of Lake Cadagno water column.

ID SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ATTENTIONAL WINDOW; AUTISM; LIGHT; EYE;

AB We assessed whether there are differences in pupil response that underlie the selection of local vs. global parts of a stimulus array in healthy adults. We designed a Navon Figures eyetracking paradigm (i.e. large figure composed of small figures), requiring an individual to vary only the information attended to within an image. We found that participants have a characteristic constriction of the pupil waveform during selection of local information relative to global information. Because stimuli and lighting conditions were identical across conditions, this indicates that pupil changes may serve in a visual filtering mechanism important for attentional selection. This work represents the first characterization of pupil response in the context of selective attention, suggesting that mechanisms underlying the earliest stages of visual processes could be relevant for perception and visual selection.

AB Perfect bilateral symmetry is the optimal outcome of the development of bilateral traits in the absence of developmental perturbations. Any random perturbation in this perfect symmetrical state is called Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA). Many studies have been conducted on FA as an indicator of Developmental Instability (DI) and its possible link with stress and individual quality in general and with attractiveness, health and level of masculinity or femininity in humans. Most human studies of facial asymmetry use 2D pictures and a limited number of landmarks. We developed a protocol to utilize high-density 3D scans of human faces to measure the level of asymmetry. A completely symmetric spatially dense anthropometric mask with paired vertices is non-rigidly mapped on target faces using an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm. A set of 19 manually indicated landmarks were used to validate the mapping precision. The protocol's accuracy in FA calculation is assessed, and results show that a spatially dense approach is more accurate. In addition, it generates an integrated asymmetry estimate across the entire face. Finally, the automatic nature of the protocol provides a great advantage by omitting the tedious step of manual landmark indication on the biological structure of interest.

TI Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey 2016: Challenges and opportunities
   of ending TB in Kenya
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   We aimed to determine the prevalence of pulmonary TB amongst the adult population (>= 15 years) in 2016 in Kenya.
   Method
   A nationwide cross-sectional survey where participants first underwent TB symptom screening and chest x-ray. Subsequently, participants who reported cough >2weeks and/or had a chest x-ray suggestive of TB, submitted sputum specimen for laboratory examination by smear microscopy, culture and Xpert MTB/RIF.
   Result
   The survey identified 305 prevalent TB cases translating to a prevalence of 558 [95%CI 455-662] per 100,000 adult population. The highest disease burden was reported among people aged 25-34 years (716 [95% CI 526-906]), males (809 [(95% CI 656-962]) and those who live in urban areas (760 [95% CI 539-981]). Compared to the reported TB notification rate for Kenya in 2016, the prevalence to notification ratio was 2.5:1. The gap between the survey prevalence and notification rates was highest among males, age groups 25-34, and the older age group of 65 years and above. Only 48% of the of the survey prevalent cases reported cough >2weeks. In addition, only 59% of the identified cases had the four cardinal symptoms for TB (cough. 2 weeks, fever, night sweat and weight loss. However, 88.2% had an abnormal chest x-ray suggestive of TB. The use of Xpert MTB/RIF identified 77.7% of the cases compared to smear microscopy's 46%. Twenty-one percent of the survey participants with respiratory symptoms reported to have sought prior health care at private clinics and chemists. Among the survey prevalent cases who reported TB related symptoms, 64.9% had not sought any health care prior to the survey.
   Conclusion
   This survey established that TB prevalence in Kenya is higher than had been estimated, and about half of the those who fall ill with the disease each year are missed.

TI Pulmonary toxicity and lung tumorigenic potential of surrogate metal
   oxides in gas metal arc welding-stainless steel fume: Iron as a primary
   mediator versus chromium and nickel
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID INHALATION EXPOSURE; SODIUM DICHROMATE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; MILD-STEEL;
   IN-VITRO; CANCER; CARCINOGENICITY; WELDERS; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES
AB In 2017, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified welding fumes as "carcinogenic to humans" (Group 1). Both mild steel (MS) welding, where fumes lack carcinogenic chromium and nickel, and stainless steel (SS) increase lung cancer risk in welders; therefore, further research to better understand the toxicity of the individual metals is needed. The objectives were to (1) compare the pulmonary toxicity of chromium (as Cr(III) oxide [Cr2O3] and Cr (VI) calcium chromate [CaCrO4]), nickel [II] oxide (NiO), iron [III] oxide (Fe2O3), and gas metal arc welding-SS (GMAW-SS) fume; and (2) determine if these metal oxides can promote lung tumors. Lung tumor susceptible A/J mice (male, 4-5 weeks old) were exposed by oropharyngeal aspiration to vehicle, GMAW-SS fume (1.7 mg), or a low or high dose of surrogate metal oxides based on the respective weight percent of each metal in the fume: Cr2O3 + CaCrO4 (366 + 5 mu g and 731 + 11 mu g), NiO (141 and 281 mu g), or Fe2O3 (1 and 2 mg). Bronchoalveolar lavage, histopathology, and lung/liver qPCR were done at 1, 7, 28, and 84 days post-aspiration. In a two-stage lung carcinogenesis model, mice were initiated with 3-methylcholanthrene (10 mu g/g; intraperitoneal; 1x) or corn oil then exposed to metal oxides or vehicle (1 x/week for 5 weeks) by oropharyngeal aspiration. Lung tumors were counted at 30 weeks post-initiation. Results indicate the inflammatory potential of the metal oxides was Fe2O3 > Cr2O3 + CaCrO4 > NiO. Overall, the pneumotoxic effects were negligible for NiO, acute but not persistent for Cr2O3 + CaCrO4, and persistent for the Fe2O3 exposures. Fe2O3, but not Cr2O3 + CaCrO4 or NiO significantly promoted lung tumors. These results provide experimental evidence that Fe2O3 is an important mediator of welding fume toxicity and support epidemiological findings and the IARC classification.

TI Older adults with disability in extreme poverty in Peru: How is their
   access to health care?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COUNTRIES; AGENDA; ADL
AB Background
   Disability rates increase with age. In 2012, Peruvian older adults (. 65 years) represented 9% of the population. Additionally, older population reported disabilities at about 5 times the rate of Peruvians between 36 and 64 years old, and 30% of older population lived in poverty. Peruvian seniors living in extreme poverty experience disabilities and the extent of their access to healthcare is unknown.
   Objective
   This study assesses associations between disability and access to healthcare among Peruvians older individuals living in extreme poverty.
   Methods
   Secondary analysis of a national representative population based survey that utilizes information from Peru's 2012 survey Health and Wellbeing in Older Adults (ESBAM), which includes older adults living in extreme poverty. We define disability in terms of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL disability) framework. Healthcare access was assessed as having any of Peru's available health insurance schemes combined with preventive health services (vision assessment, influenza vaccination, blood pressure assessment, diabetes screening, and cholesterol assessment). Poisson robust regression models were used to evaluate the associations among relevant variables. Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported.
   Results
   Data from 3869 individuals (65 to 80 years old), of whom 1760 (45.5%) were females, were analyzed. The prevalence of ADL disability was 17.3% (95%CI: 16.0%-18.4%). In addition, more than 60% had never received any of the preventive measures evaluated, except for the blood pressure assessment. In the adjusted model, people with ADL disability had 63% less probability of having extensive insurance, compared to those without disability (p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   This study shows that this Peruvian older population living in extreme poverty has limited access to healthcare services. Although there was no consistent association between ADL disability and the healthcare access, there is an urgent need to reduce the inequitable access to healthcare of this poor Peruvian older population.

TI Spatial constraints on the diffusion of religious innovations: The case
   of early Christianity in the Roman Empire
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLEX
AB Christianity emerged as a small and marginal movement in the first century Palestine and throughout the following three centuries it became highly visible in the whole Mediterranean. Little is known about the mechanisms of spreading innovative ideas in past societies. Here we investigate how well the spread of Christianity can be explained as a diffusive process constrained by physical travel in the Roman Empire. First, we combine a previously established model of the transportation network with city population estimates and evaluate to which extent the spatio-temporal pattern of the spread of Christianity can be explained by static factors. Second, we apply a network-theoretical approach to analyze the spreading process utilizing effective distance. We show that the spread of Christianity in the first two centuries closely follows a gravity-guided diffusion, and is substantially accelerated in the third century. Using the effective distance measure, we are able to suggest the probable path of the spread. Our work demonstrates how the spatio-temporal patterns we observe in the data can be explained using only spatial constraints and urbanization structure of the empire. Our findings also provide a methodological framework to be reused for studying other cultural spreading phenomena.

   ORIGIN
AB Local field potential (LFP) recording is a very useful electrophysiological method to study brain processes. However, this method is criticized for recording low frequency activity in a large area of extracellular space potentially contaminated by distal activity. Here, we theoretically and experimentally compare ground-referenced (RR) with differential recordings (DR). We analyze electrical activity in the rat cortex with these two methods. Compared with RR, DR reveals the importance of local phasic oscillatory activities and their coherence between cortical areas. Finally, we show that DR provides a more faithful assessment of functional connectivity caused by an increase in the signal to noise ratio, and of the delay in the propagation of information between two cortical structures.

AB The species-rich diatom family Chaetocerotaceae is common in the coastal marine phytoplankton worldwide where it is responsible for a substantial part of the primary production. Despite its relevance for the global cycling of carbon and silica, many species are still described only morphologically, and numerous specimens do not fit any described taxa. Nowadays, studies to assess plankton biodiversity deploy high throughput sequencing metabarcoding of the 18S rDNA V4 region, but to translate the gathered metabarcodes into biologically meaningful taxa, there is a need for reference barcodes. However, 18S reference barcodes for this important family are still relatively scarce. We provide 18S rDNA and partial 28S rDNA reference sequences of 443 morphologically characterized chaetocerotacean strains. We gathered 164 of the 216 18S sequences and 244 of the 413 28S sequences of strains from the Gulf of Naples, Atlantic France, and Chile. Inferred phylogenies showed 84 terminal taxa in seven principal clades. Two of these clades included terminal taxa whose rDNA sequences contained spliceosomal and Group IC1 introns. Regarding the commonly used metabarcode markers in planktonic diversity studies, all terminal taxa can be discriminated with the 18S V4 hypervariable region; its primers fit their targets in all but two species, and the V4-tree topology is similar to that of the 18S. Hence V4-metabarcodes of unknown Chaetocerotaceae are assignable to the family. Regarding the V9 hypervariable region, most terminal taxa can be discriminated, but several contain introns in their primer targets. Moreover, poor phylogenetic resolution of the V9 region affects placement of metabarcodes of putative but unknown chaetocerotacean taxa, and hence, uncertainty in taxonomic assignment, even of higher taxa.

AB Numerical investigations are an important research tool in quantum information theory. There already exists a wide range of computational tools for quantum information theory implemented in various programming languages. However, there is little effort in implementing this kind of tools in the Julia language. Julia is a modern programming language designed for numerical computation with excellent support for vector and matrix algebra, extended type system that allows for implementation of elegant application interfaces and support for parallel and distributed computing. QuantumInformation.jl is a new quantum information theory library implemented in Julia that provides functions for creating and analyzing quantum states, and for creating quantum operations in various representations. An additional feature of the library is a collection of functions for sampling random quantum states and operations such as unitary operations and generic quantum channels.

AB Among 98 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae, only a small subset regularly causes invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD). We previously demonstrated that serotype 11A binds to ficolin-2 and has low invasiveness in children. Epidemiologic data suggested, however, that serotype 11A IPD afflicts older adults, possibly indicating reduced ficolin-2-mediated immune protection. Therefore, we studied the epidemiology of ficolin-2-bound serotypes. We obtained IPD case data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We studied three prominent ficolin-2-bound serotypes and their acetyltransferase-deficient variants for ficolin-2 binding and ficolin-2-mediated complement deposition with flow-cytometry. We determined the age distributions of these serotypes from the obtained epidemiologic data. We discovered that the serotype 35B capsule is a novel ficolin- 2 ligand due to O-acetylation via WciG. Ficolin-2-mediated complement deposition was observed on serotypes 11A and 35B but not serotype 31 or any O-acetyl transferase deficient derivatives of these serotypes. Serotypes 11A, 35B, and 31 cause more IPD among older adults than children. Studies of the three serotypes provide additional evidence for ficolin-2 providing innate immunity against IPD. The skewed age distribution of the three serotypes suggests that older adults have reduced ficolin-2-mediated immunity and are more susceptible to these serotypes.

ID MANDATORY RETIREMENT; RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY; AGE; IMPACT; TOO
AB Studies of rescuing early-career scientists often take narrow approaches and focus on PhD students or postdoc populations. In a multi-method systems approach, we examine the inter-relations between the two ends of the pipeline and ask: what are the effects of late retirement on aging and hiring in academia? With a simulation model, we postulate that the decline in the retirement rate in academia contributes to the aging pattern through two mechanisms: (a) direct effect: longer stay of established professors, and (b) indirect effect: a hiring decline in tenure-track positions. Late retirement explains more than half of the growth in average age and brings about 20% decline in hiring. We provide empirical evidence based on the natural experimental set-up of the removal of mandatory retirement in the 1990s.

TI A TNFSF13B functional variant is not involved in systemic sclerosis and
   giant cell arteritis susceptibility
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BAFF; HOMEOSTASIS
AB Background
   The TNFSF13B (TNF superfamily member 13b) gene encodes BAFF, a cytokine with a crucial role in the differentiation and activation of B cells. An insertion-deletion variant (GCTGT -> A) of this gene, leading to increased levels of BAFF, has been recently implicated in the genetic predisposition to several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Based on the elevated levels of this cytokine found in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), we aimed to assess whether this functional variant also represents a novel genetic risk factor for these two disorders.
   Methods
   A total of 1,728 biopsy-proven GCA patients from 4 European cohorts, 4,584 SSc patients from 3 European cohorts and 5,160 ethnically-matched healthy controls were included in the study. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs374039502, which colocalizes with the genetic variant previously implicated in autoimmunity, was genotyped using a custom TaqMan assay. First, association analysis was conducted in each independent cohort using chi(2) test in Plink (v1.9). Subsequently, different case/control sets were meta-analyzed by the inverse variance method.
   Results
   No statistically significant differences were found when allele distributions were compared between cases and controls for any of the analyzed cohorts. Similarly, combined analysis of the different sets evidenced a lack of association of the rs374039502 variant with GCA (P = 0.421; OR (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.75-1.13)) and SSc (P = 0.500; OR (95% CI) = 1.05 (0.91-1.22)). The stratified analysis considering the main clinical subphenotypes of these diseases yielded similar negative results.
   Conclusion
   Our data suggest that the TNFSF13B functional variant does not contribute to the genetic network underlying GCA and SSc.

TI P38 MAPK inhibition prevents polybrene-induced senescence of human
   mesenchymal stem cells during viral transduction
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID MEDIATED GENE-TRANSFER; CELLULAR SENESCENCE; DNA-DAMAGE; LENTIVIRAL
   TRANSDUCTION; EFFICIENCY
AB The unique capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to migrate to the sites of damage, following intravenous transplantation, along with their proliferation and differentiation abilities make them promising candidates for MSC-based gene therapy. This therapeutic approach requires high efficacy delivery of stable transgenes to ensure their adequate expression in MSCs. One of the methods to deliver transgenes is via the viral transduction of MSCs. However, due to low transduction efficiency of MSCs, various polications are used to promote the association of viral particles with membranes of target cells. Among these polications polybrene is the most widely used one. Unfortunately, viral infection in presence of polybrene was shown to negatively affect proliferation rate of stem cells. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect is not yet uncovered. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon as well as to develop an effective approach to overcome the negative impact of polybrene on the properties of human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMESCs) during lentiviral infection. We found that the negative effect on proliferation observed during the viral infection in presence of polybrene is mediated by the polycation itself. Furthermore, we revealed that the treatment with polybrene alone led to the p38 MAPK-dependent premature senescence of hMESCs. These findings allowed us to develop an effective strategy to attenuate the negative polybrene impact on the hMESCs properties during lentiviral infection by inhibiting the activity of p38 MAPK. Importantly, the proposed approach did not attenuate the transduction efficiency of hMESCs, yet prevented polybrene-induced senescence and thereby restored the proliferation of the infected cells. These results provide the plausible means to reduce side effects of polybrene during the viral infection of primary cells, particularly MSCs.

DT Article
ID CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; HAMBURG NETWORK; DISORDERS; ANXIETY;
   IMPLEMENTATION; PREVALENCE; ADULTS
AB In order to optimize patient allocation, guidelines recommend stepped and collaborative care models (SCM) including low-intensity treatments. The aim of this study is to investigate the implementation of guideline-adherent treatments in a SCM for depression in routine care. We analyzed care provider documentation data of n = 569 patients treated within a SCM. Rates of guideline-adherent treatment selections and initializations as well as accordance between selected and initialized treatment were evaluated for patients with mild, moderate and severe depression. Guideline-adherent treatment selection and initialization was highest for mild depression (91% resp. 85%). For moderate depression, guideline-adherent treatments were selected in 68% and applied in 54% of cases. Guideline adherence was lowest for severe depression (59% resp. 19%). In a multiple mixed logistic regression model a significant interaction between guideline adherence in treatment selection/initialization and severity degree was found. The differences between treatment selection and initialization were significant for moderate (OR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.30 to 2.59; p = 0.0006]) and severe depression (OR: 6.9; [95% CI: 4.24 to 11.25; p < .0001] but not for mild depression (OR = 1.8, [95%-CI: 0.68 to 4.56; p = 0.2426]). Accordance between selected and initialized treatment was highest for mild and lowest for severe depression. We conclude that SCMs potentially improve care for mild depression and guideline adherence of treatment selections. Guideline adherence of treatment initialization and accordance between treatment selection and initialization varies with depression severity. Deficits in treating severe depression adequately may be more a problem of failed treatment initializations than of inadequate treatment selections.

AB To what extent do our free-living physical activity (PA) levels impact our cognition? For example, if we engage in more intense PA from one week to the next, does this have a corresponding influence on cognitive performance? Across three studies, young adults completed a validated self-report questionnaire (the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, or IPAQ) assessing their involvement in PA at low, moderate, and vigorous intensities over the past week, as well as computer-based measures of executive control and attentional function. In Experiment 1 we found no significant effect of PA intensity on any of our measures of executive control. In a pair of follow-up control studies we examined whether these null findings could be attributed to testing fatigue and task complexity (Experiment 2), or low cognitive demands of the task (Experiment 3). Despite simplifying the task, reducing testing time, and increasing the cognitive load of the task, we still found no significant impact of weekly PA intensity on our measures of executive control. Taken together, our results show that self-reported PA over the past week, at any intensity level, does not appear to have a substantive impact on executive control.

AB The connections between the error function used in multilinear regression and the expected, or assumed, properties of the data are investigated. It is shown that two of the most basic properties often required in data analysis, scale and rotational invariance, are incompatible. With this, it is established that multilinear regression using an error function derived from a geometric mean is both scale and reflectively invariant. The resulting error function is also shown to have the property that its minimizer, under certain conditions, is well approximated using the centroid of the error simplex. It is then applied to several multidimensional real world data sets, and compared to other regression methods.

AB Oyster reef restoration can significantly increase benthic denitrification rates. Methods applied to measure nutrient fluxes and denitrification from oyster reefs in previous studies include incubations of sediment cores collected adjacent to oyster clumps, benthic chambers filled with intact reef segments that have undergone in situ equilibration and ex situ incubation, and cores with single oysters. However, fluxes of nutrients vary by orders of magnitude among oyster reefs and methods. This study compares two methods of measuring nutrient and metabolic fluxes on restored oyster reefs: incubations including intact segments of oyster reef and incubations containing oyster clumps without underlying sediments. Fluxes of oxygen (O-2), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ammonium (NH4+), combined nitrate and nitrite (NO2/3-), di-nitrogen (N-2), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were determined in June and August in Harris Creek, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA. Regression of fluxes measured from clumps alone against those measured from intact reef segments showed significant positive relationships for O-2, DIC, NH4+, and SRP (R-2 = 0.920, 0.61, 0.26, and 0.52, respectively). Regression of clump fluxes against the oyster tissue biomass indicates significant positive relationships for O-2 and NH4+, marginally significant and positive relationships for DIC and N-2, and no significant relationship for NO2/3- or SRP. Although these results demonstrate that the incubation of oyster clumps without underlying sediments does not accurately represent biogeochemical fluxes measured from the whole oyster and sediment community, this work supports the need to understand the balance between the metabolism of oysters and local sediments to correctly estimate biogeochemical rates.

AB The two stocks of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska include an endangered western stock, recently recovering in parts of its range following decades of decline, and an eastern stock which was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2013 following increasing numbers since the 1970s. Information on overlapping distributions of eastern and western sea lions is needed for management considerations. We analyzed >30,000 sightings collected from 2000-2014 of 2,385 sea lions that were branded as pups at 10 Alaskan rookeries to examine mesoscale (mostly <500km) spatial distribution, geographic range, and geographic population structure based on natal rookery, sex, and age during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Analyses of summary movement measures (e.g., natal rookery, sex, and age-class differences in spatial distribution and geographic range) indicate wide variation in rookery-specific movement patterns. Correlations between movement measures and population dynamics suggested movement patterns could be a function of density dependence. Animals from larger rookeries, and rookeries with slower population growth and lower survival, had wider dispersion than animals from smaller rookeries, or rookeries with high growth and survival. Sea lions from the largest rookery, Forrester Island, where survival and population trends are lowest, were the most widely distributed. Analysis of geographic population structure indicated that animals born in the eastern Aleutian Islands had the most distinct movements and had little overlap with other western sea lions. Northern Southeast Alaska, within the eastern stock, is the area of greatest overlap between stocks, and is important to western animals, especially those born in Prince William Sound. Detailed knowledge of distribution and movements of western sea lions is useful for defining recovery and population trend analysis regions that better reflect dispersion and population structure and provides valuable information to managers as critical habitat is re-evaluated and the location of the stock boundary reconsidered.

AB Background
   Since 2015, more than 3 million refugees have reached the European Union. In order to receive and integrate them, societies heavily rely on relief organizations and private initiatives. Yet the well-being, work-satisfaction and possible health implications for refugee helpers have not been adequately addressed.
   Methods
   In a German national cross-sectional study, we gathered socio-demographic data on refugee helpers. Work satisfaction was examined by means of Neuberger and Allerbeck's Work Description Inventory. We screened for depression by using the 5-item WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using the PTSD Short Screening Scale (PTSD-7). 1712 questionnaires were analyzed.
   Results
   Females accounted for 73.4% (1235), the mean age was 52.0 years (SD: 14.4). 61.6% were academics (1042). 87.0% (1454) were voluntary helpers who invested 9.4 hours (SD: 8.9) per week. Refugee helpers were more satisfied with the content than with the conditions or the organization of their work. Their work satisfaction and overall life satisfaction reached higher values than in representative samples. The mean WHO-5 index for refugee helpers was 68.2 points (SD: 19.0). Positive depression screening was found in 17.3% (226). 982 (57.4%) had experienced a traumatic event in their past or witnessed it during their work in refugee aid. 33 (2.8%) of the helpers had a positive PTSD screening.
   Conclusions
   Refugee helpers deliver invaluable services to migrants and receiving communities. Our data indicates above average well-being as well as work-satisfaction. Psychological traumatization is found frequently but fortunately PTSD is rare. All efforts should be made to uphold helpers' keen spirit and contributions. They should be screened regularly with regards to work satisfaction, well-being and mental health. As part of a comprehensive health promotion strategy they should be instructed about depression, psychological trauma, PTSD and ways to find help.

DT Article
ID INFECTION
AB Introduction
   Tenofovir (TDF)-containing PrEP is effective for HIV prevention, but its effect on health-related quality of life (QOL) is unknown. Using data from HPTN 069/ACTG A5305, a randomized study of potential PrEP regimens comparing maraviroc alone, or together with TDF or emtricitabine (FTC), to TDF + FTC (control), we evaluated the impact of these regimens on QOL in at-risk HIV-uninfected U.S. women and men.
   Methods
   QOL was measured at baseline (before starting medications) and every 8 weeks through week 48 using the EQ-5D-3L. Responses were converted to a scale from 0.0 (death) to 1.0 (perfect health), using published valuation weights. Mean scores were compared between groups at each time point using nonparametric testing. Multivariable linear regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.
   Results
   We analyzed 186 women (median age 35 years, 65% black, 17% Hispanic) and 405 men (median age 30 years, 28% black, 22% Hispanic), including 9 transgender participants analyzed based on sex-at-birth. Mean baseline QOL was 0.91 for women and 0.95 for men. There were minimal changes in mean QOL over time for any regimen (women: p = 0.29; men: p = 0.14). There were no significant differences between participants who continued the regimen compared to participants who discontinued early (women: p = 0.61; men: p = 0.1). Mean QOL did not differ significantly by regimen at any time point, both unadjusted and after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, adherence, and use of alcohol, marijuana, opiates, and other substances.
   Conclusions
   QOL in at-risk individuals starting candidate PrEP regimens in a clinical trial is similar to the general population and maintained over time. This finding did not vary among regimens or when adjusted for demographics, adherence, and substance use. Our findings are the first to show that starting a candidate PrEP regimen in at-risk HIV-uninfected U.S. women and men was not associated with significant changes in QOL.

AB Wildland fires are a dominant disturbance on Earth. On the local scale, fire activity is also influenced by species-specific fire behaviour of leaf litter beds. Thus, researchers strive to identify plant functional traits governing fire behaviour. The currently accepted relationships between morphological characteristics of the individual particles, fuel bed structure and resulting fire behaviour have been established on freshly constructed leaf litter beds. To investigate to what degree these relationships are altered upon exposure of constructed leaf litter beds to outside weather conditions, a novel testing system was designed. It enables outdoor exposure of the constructed litter beds, their subsequent retrieval and fire behaviour testing without disturbing the sample structure. Two treatments were applied on seven monospecific leaf litters. "Fresh treatment" corresponded to the common practice of testing fire behaviour directly after fuel bed construction. In the "settled treatment" constructed fuel beds were exposed for 30 days to outside weather conditions before being tested. The "settled treatment" was designed to address physical changes in the fuel bed structure which occur due to repeated wetting of the fuel bed. Thus, to minimise the effects of decomposition and fragmentation, winter exposure was chosen. Within the "fresh treatment" previously established relationships between size, curl, bulk density and fire behaviour characteristics could be confirmed. In the "settled treatment" the majority of these relationships lost their significance. The "settled treatment" had significantly lower bulk density (BD), rate of spread, maximum flame height and maximum sand temperature at 1 cm depth; and significantly higher flaming duration and amount of unburned residues compared to the "fresh treatment". Species with low initial BD were more affected by the treatment than species with high initial BD. The abrupt change in the fire behaviour of some leaf litter beds and the loss of numerous relationships between morphological characteristics of the individual particles and fire behaviour characteristics upon settled treatment indicate that fast occurring changes in the fuel bed structure should be taken into consideration if we are to understand the relationships between functional traits and local fire activity.

   We used the 4th and 5th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationwide survey conducted from the year 2007 to 2012. Economically active workers between the ages of 25 and 64 were grouped into standard, nonstandard, the self-employed, and the unpaid family workers (N = 16,964). Outcome variables are the uptake of preventive health services including influenza vaccination, regular medical check-up, and four types of cancer screenings. We used multivariate logistic models.
   Results
   Overall, non-standard workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers were less likely to use the preventive health care compared to the standard workers. In particular, the self-employed were less likely to use all the six services compared to the standard workers and showed the lowest level of uptakes among the four working groups. Moreover, the service uptake of the non-standard workers was lower than that of standard workers in all services; except the colon cancer screening. On the other hand, unpaid family workers showed mixed results. While the uptake of influenza vaccination and regular health screening were lower, participation to the cancer screening was not lower compared to that of standard workers.
   Conclusion
   There were gaps in the utilisation of preventive services among workers depending on their employment types. Access to preventive health care services of nonstandard workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers should be prioritised.

AB Pair bonds are often maintained through the reciprocal and coordinated exchange of communicative signals. The ability to recognize and appropriately respond to a partner's signals will define a pair's ability to reproduce. Individual variation in responsiveness, by shaping the formation and maintenance of strong pair bonds, will ultimately influence an individual's reproductive output. Throughout the breeding period, female cowbirds (Molothrus ater) respond to male song displays using a vocalization known as the chatter. In this study, we investigated whether variation in chatters remained repeatable across years and predicted reproductive performance. A flock of cowbirds housed in a large aviary complex was observed during the spring of 2011 to 2012. We recorded courtship interactions, including singing behavior for males, and chatters and eggs laid by females. The rate with which females responded to song using chatters remained consistent across years, with some females predictably responding to more songs using chatters than others. During 2012, chattering predicted the number of eggs females laid and her paired status. Paired females were more likely to respond to songs with chatters, and there was a strong positive relationship between the number of eggs laid and the proportion of songs she responded to using chatters. Overall, these findings suggest that variation in female vocal behavior is associated with their reproductive success.

AB Tetragenococcus halophilus is a halophilic lactic acid bacterium that exists in the traditional Japanese seasoning miso-a fermented soy paste. Considering the popularity of miso as a component of healthy diet, we attempted to evaluate the immunoregulatory functions of T. halophilus spices isolated from miso. We screened 56 strains that facilitated the upregulation of activation markers such as CD86 and CD69 on B cells and T cells in vitro. Of these, 7 strains (Nos. 1, 3, 13, 15, 19, 30, and 31) were found to preferentially induce the CD86 expression on B cells. Furthermore, DNA microarray analysis revealed that T. halophilus strain No. 1 significantly augmented the gene expressions of CD86, CD70, IL-10, INF-gamma, and IL-22 in B cells. We confirmed these results at the protein level by flow cytometry. Mice feeding diet containing 1% T. halophilus No. 1 exhibited significantly greater IgA production in the serum. Furthermore, a diet containing 1% T. halophilus No. 1 augmented ovoalbumin (OVA)-specific IgG titer in mice upon OVA/alum immunization. Thus, we demonstrated that T. halophilus No. 1 is a strong immunomodulatory strain with potential as a probiotic.

AB Together with nematodes and rotifers, tardigrade belong to micrometazoans that can cope with environmental extremes such as UV and solar radiations, dehydration, supercooling or overheating. Tardigrade can resist the harshest conditions by turning to cryptobiosis, an anhydrobiotic state that results from almost complete dehydration and is characterized by an ametabolic status. Although reports have challenged the molecular basis of the mechanisms underlying genomic injury resistance, little is yet known regarding the possible involvement of other tardigrade macromolecules in injury during a stress experience. In this report, we show that the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris can accumulate molecular damages by means of in situ detection of carbonyls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that living tardigrade can accumulate carbonylation. Finally, we reveal that anhydrobiotic tardigrade can be constitutively affected by carbonylation that marks aging in other metazoans.

TI Non-consensual condom removal, reported by patients at a sexual health
   clinic in Melbourne, Australia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HIV; MEN; ALCOHOL; RISK; NEGOTIATION
AB Background
   Non-consensual removal of condoms, colloquially referred to as 'stealthing', is the removal of a condom during sex by a sexual partner when consent has been given for sex with a condom only.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey to determine how commonly women and men who have sex with men (MSM) attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre had experienced stealthing, and analysed situational factors associated with the event. Responses were linked to demographic information extracted from patient files.
   Results
   1189 of 2883 women (41.2%), and 1063 of 3439 MSM (30.9%) attending the clinic during the study period completed the survey. Thirty-two percent of women (95% CI: 29%, 35%) and 19% of MSM (95% CI: 17%, 22%) reported having ever experienced stealthing. Women who had been stealthed were more likely to be a current sex worker (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 2.87, 95% CI: 2.01,4.11, p <0.001). MSM who had experienced stealthing were more likely to report anxiety or depression (AOR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.25,3.60, p = 0.005). Both female and male participants who had experienced stealthing were three times less likely to consider it to be sexual assault than participants who had not experienced it (OR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.22,0.4 and OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.21,0.45 respectively).
   Conclusions
   A high proportion of women and MSM attending a sexual health service reported having experienced stealthing. While further investigation is needed into the prevalence of stealthing in the general community, clinicians should be aware of this practice and consider integrating this question into their sexual health consultation. Understanding situational factors would assist in the development of preventive strategies, particularly female sex workers and MSM.

AB Previous studies investigating the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on muscle strength showed no consensus. Therefore, the purpose of this article was to systematically review the literature on the effects of single dose tDCS to improve muscle strength. A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMeb, ISI Web of Science, SciELO, and Scopus using search terms regarding tDCS and muscle strength. Studies were included in accordance with Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Setting (PICOS) including criteria. Healthy men and women, strength training practitioners or sedentary were selected. The acute effects of single dose anode stimulus of tDCS (a-tDCS) and the placebo stimulus of tDCS (sham) or no interventions were considered as an intervention and comparators, respectively. Measures related to muscle strength were analyzed. To conduct the analyses a weighted mean difference (WMD) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) were applied as appropriate. A total of 15 studies were included in this systematic review and 14 in meta-analysis. Regarding the maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC), a small effect was seen between tDCS and Sham with significant difference between the conditions (SMD = 0.29; CI95% = 0.05 to 0.54; Z = 2.36; p = 0.02). The muscular endurance measured by the seconds sustaining a percentage of MIVC demonstrated a large effect between tDCS and Sham (WMD = 43.66; CI95% = 29.76 to 57.55; Z = 6.16; p < 0.001), showing an improvement in muscular endurance after exposure to tDCS. However, muscular endurance based on total work showed a trivial effect between tDCS and Sham with no significant difference (SMD = 0.22; CI95% = -0.11 to 0.54; Z = 1.32, p = 0.19). This study suggests that the use of tDCS may promote increase in maximal voluntary contraction and muscular endurance through isometric contractions.

AB Introduction
   Colorectal cancer is associated with considerable physical and psychosocial burden. Whilst social support is known to facilitate psychological adjustment to cancer, patients' and caregivers' experiences of social support within a treatment setting and their perceptions of the role of the treating team in providing this support is unknown. Specifically, there is a gap in the research that explores in detail who people affected by colorectal cancer consider to be supportive, and the function, timing and nature of this support, whilst receiving treatment. This study explored both patients' and caregivers' a) experiences of social support and how this relates to their experience of treatment; and b) what facilitates support in the treatment setting.
   Methods
   Individual interviews (N = 20) were conducted with patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and caregivers of such patients. Audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework method.
   Results
   Three major themes emerged from the data: a) treating team as a source of support, highlighting the importance of connection with the treating team; b) changes in existing social supports, encompassing issues regarding distance in interpersonal relationships as a consequence of cancer; and c) differing dimensions of support, exploring the significance of shared experience, practical, financial, and emotional support.
   Conclusions
   Patients and caregivers perceived the treating team as a major source of support. Support from the treating team was particularly important in the context of the changes that occur as a result of a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the effects of subsequent treatment. Incidental support from others encountered in the treatment setting was also experienced and was equally important to both patients and caregivers. This has implications for the way health care professionals respond to both patients and caregivers in the treatment setting in terms of communication, interventions and environment.

AB Background
   Patients with atrial fibrillation are known to have a high risk of mortality. There is a paucity of population-based studies about the impact of atrial fibrillation on the mortality risk stratified by age, sex, and detailed causes of death.
   Methods
   A total of 15,411 patients with atrial fibrillation from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort were enrolled, and causes of death were identified according to codes of the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases.
   Results
   From 2002 to 2013, a total of 4,479 (29%) deaths were confirmed, and the crude mortality rate for all-cause death was 63.3 per 1,000 patient-years. Patients with atrial fibrillation had a 3.7-fold increased risk of all-cause death compared with the general population. The standardized mortality ratio for all-cause death was the highest in young patients and decreased with increasing age (standardized mortality ratio 21.93, 95% confidence interval 7.60-26.26 in patients aged <20 years; standardized mortality ratio 2.77, 95% confidence interval 2.63-2.91 in patients aged >= 80 years). Women with atrial fibrillation exhibited a greater excess mortality risk than men (standardized mortality ratio 3.81, 95% confidence interval 3.65-3.98 in women; standardized mortality ratio 3.35, 95% confidence interval 3.21-3.48 in men). Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death (38.5%), and cerebral infarction was the most common specific disease. Patients with atrial fibrillation had an about 5 times increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease compared with the general population.
   Conclusions
   Patients with atrial fibrillation had a 4 times increased risk of mortality compared with the general population. However, the impact of atrial fibrillation on mortality decreased with age and in men. Cerebral infarction was the most common cause of death, and more attention should be paid to reducing the risk of stroke.

TI Associations between birth kit use and maternal and neonatal health
   outcomes in rural Jigawa state, Nigeria: A secondary analysis of data
   from a cluster randomized controlled trial
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLEAN DELIVERY KIT; INTERVENTION; MORTALITY; IMPACT; DEATH; CARE
AB Background
   The burden of maternal and neonatal mortality remains persistently high in Nigeria. Sepsis contributes significantly to both maternal and newborn mortality, and safe delivery kits have long been promoted as a cost-effective intervention to ensure hygienic delivery practices and reduce sepsis. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of home birth kit distribution by community health workers, and particularly the impact of this intervention on health outcomes. This paper reports a secondary analysis of data from a cluster randomized trial in rural northern Nigeria in which birth kits were distributed by community health workers to pregnant women in their homes, analyzing non-experimental variation in receipt and use of birth kits. More specifically, associations between pregnant women's baseline characteristics and receipt and use of birth kits, and associations between birth kit use, care utilization and maternal and newborn outcomes were assessed.
   Methods and findings
   Baseline, post-birth and endline data related to 3,317 births observed over a period of three years in 72 intervention communities in Jigawa state, Nigeria, were analyzed using hierarchical, logistic regression models. In total, 140 women received birth kits, and 72 women used the kits. There were no associations between baseline demographic characteristics, health history, and knowledge and attitudes and receipt of a kit, suggesting that community health workers did not systematically target the distribution of birth kits. However, women who used the kit reported reduced odds of past pregnancy complications (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.19-1.00) as well as significantly higher odds of feeling generally healthy at baseline (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.06-3.76), of exposure to radio media (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.21-3.22), and of perceiving themselves as having a low-risk pregnancy (OR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.39-6.68). While there were no significant associations between birth kit use and facility based delivery, skilled birth attendance or post-natal care, women who used a kit exhibited significantly lower odds of completing four or more ANC visits (adjusted OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18-0.85) and significantly higher odds of reporting prolonged labor (adjusted OR = 4.75, 95% CI: 1.36-16.59), and post-partum bleeding (adjusted OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.11-9.52).
   Conclusions
   This evidence suggests that use of birth kits is low in a rural population characterized by minimal baseline utilization of maternal and neonatal health services, and the use of birth kits was not associated with reductions in maternal or neonatal morbidity. While further research is required to understand how the effectiveness of birth kits may be shaped by the mechanism through which women access and utilize the kits, our findings suggest that the provision of kits to women outside of the formal health system may be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.

AB Detailed clonal phenotypic/genotypic analyses explored viral-escape mechanisms during maraviroc-based therapy in highly treatment-experienced participants from the MOTIVATE trials. To allow real-time assessment of samples while maintaining a blind trial, the first 267 enrolled participants were selected for evaluation. At failure, plasma samples from 20/50 participants (16/20 maraviroc-treated) with CXCR4-using virus and all 38 (13 maraviroc-treated) with CCR5-tropic virus were evaluated. Of those maraviroc-treated participants with CXCR4-using virus at failure, genotypic and phenotypic clonal tropism determinations showed >90% correspondence in 14/16 at Day 1 and 14/16 at failure. Phylogenetic analysis of clonal sequences detected pre-treatment progenitor CXCR4-using virus, or on-treatment virus highly divergent from the Day 1 R5 virus, excluding possible co-receptor switch through maraviroc-mediated evolution. Re-analysis of pre-treatment samples using the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile (R) assay detected CXCR4-using virus pre-treatment in 16/20 participants failing with CXCR4-using virus. Post-maraviroc reversion of CXCR4-use to CCR5-tropic occurred in 7/8 participants with follow-up, suggesting selective maraviroc inhibition of CCR5-tropic variants in a mixed-tropic viral population, not emergence of de novo mutations in CCR5-tropic virus, as the main virologic escape mechanism. Maraviroc-resistant CCR5-tropic virus was observed in plasma from 5 treated participants with virus displaying reduced maximal percent inhibition (MPI) but no evidence of IC50 change. Env clones with reduced MPI showed 1-5 amino acid changes specific to each V3-loop region of env relative to Day 1. However, transferring on-treatment resistance-associated changes using site-directed mutagenesis did not always establish resistance in Day 1 virus, and key 'signature' mutation patterns associated with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc were not identified. Evolutionary divergence of the CXCR4-using viruses is confirmed, emphasizing natural selection not influenced directly by maraviroc; maraviroc simply unmasks pre-existing lineages by inhibiting the R5 virus. For R5-viral failure, resistance development through drug selection pressure was uncommon and manifested through reduced MPI and with virus strain-specific mutational patterns.

TI A novel financial risk assessment model for companies based on

AB The financial risk not only affects the development of the company itself, but also affects the economic development of the whole society; therefore, the financial risk assessment of company is an important part. At present, numerous methods of financial risk assessment have been researched by scholars. However, most of the extant methods neither integrated fuzzy sets with quantitative analysis, nor took into account the historical data of the past few years. To settle these defects, this paper proposes a novel financial risk assessment model for companies based on heterogeneous multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and historical data. Subjective and objective indexes are comprehensively taken into consideration in the financial risk assessment index system of the model, which combines fuzzy theory with quantitative data analysis. Moreover, the assessment information obtained from historical financial information of company, credit rating agency and decision makers, including crisp numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers and neutrosophic numbers. Furthermore, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to determine the ranking order of companies according to their financial risk. Finally, an empirical study of financial risk assessment for companies is conducted, and the results of comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis suggest that the proposed model can effectively and reliably obtain the company with the lowest financial risk.

TI Self-assembled micro-computed tomography for dental education
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CT; RECONSTRUCTION; ROOT
AB This study used available or purchased equipment and an image reconstruction system developed by the college of dentistry to establish a basic self-assembled micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system. Such a system would be suitable for teaching dental radiology to dental students. Specifically, it could help students to understand the principles governing dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and provide graduate students with a system for scanning small samples (e.g., individual teeth) during the early stages of research. The self-assembled micro-CT system was constructed using a portable dental Xray tube, an intraoral digital X-ray detector, a high-precision rotation stage, related bracket accessories, and a notebook computer. Reconstructed images and three-dimensional models of the maxillary right third molar were produced using the self-assembled micro-CT system and an advanced commercially available micro-CT system (Skyscan 2211). Subsequently, the reconstructed images and 3D models produced using the two systems were compared by two senior dentists to determine whether considerable visual differences could be observed. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was used for quantitative analysis and to compare the systems. Although the self-assembled micro-CT system produced image boundaries that were not as sharp as those of Skyscan 2211, the images were nonetheless remarkably similar. In addition, the two micro-CT systems produced 3D models that were almost identical in appearance and root canal shape. Quantitative analysis revealed that Skyscan 2211 had produced a SNR that was superior to that of the self-assembled micro-CT system, with the difference ranging from 36.77% to 136.22%; enamel, which has a higher density, exhibited lower SNR differences, whereas dentin, which has a lower density, exhibited higher SNR differences. The self-assembled micro-CT system with a resolution of 36 mu m was created using a portable dental X-ray tube and an intraoral digital X-ray detector. Although the scanning time was relatively long (similar to 30 min to scan images of a tooth), the images were adequate in the preliminary stage of experiments. More importantly, students were afforded the opportunity to observe the process of assembling and disassembling each component of a micro-CT scanner and thereby achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the principles governing micro-CT and dental CBCT.

TI Valuation of the EQ-5D-5L in Taiwan
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VALUE SET; HEALTH STATES; VERSION; CARE
AB Objectives
   To date, a value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on the health state preferences of the general Taiwanese population has not been available. This study aimed to develop a Taiwanese value set for EQ-5D-5L to facilitate health technology assessment for medical products and services.
   Methods
   An international standardized protocol for EQ-5D-5L valuation studies developed by the EuroQol group was adopted. Adult members of the general public were recruited from six geographic regions in Taiwan. In computer-based face-to-face interviews, each participant completed 10 composite time trade-off (C-TTO) tasks and 7 discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks. The C-TTO and DCE data were modeled alone or in combination (using hybrid models) with additive models containing 20 dummy variables as main effects. The model performance was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively (mainly logical consistency and prediction patterns).
   Results
   Of 1,073 recruited participants, 1,000 completed the study. Approximately 13% of observed utility values were -1 in the C-TTO tasks. The hybrid model, using all available data that assumed C-TTO response values left-censored at -1 and with main effects coefficients with logical consistency (monotonicity), was considered as the most appropriate model. The predicted utility ranged from -1.0259 to 1.
   Conclusions
   An EQ-5D-5L value set was developed for Taiwan using an established study protocol and a representative sample of the general population. This may facilitate health economic evaluations and decision making on resource allocation under Taiwan's national health insurance program in the future.

AB Purpose
   The literature lacks population-based epidemiologic studies on the incidence and risk factors for traumatic foot fractures. The purpose of this study was to update information concerning the incidence of foot fractures in China and to identify associated risk factors.
   Methods
   All the data on foot fractures were available from the China National Fracture Survey (CNFS), which was conducted between January and May in 2015. A total of 8 provinces, 24 urban cities and 24 rural counties in China were selected, using stratified random sampling and the probability proportional to size method. Individuals who had lived in their current residence for 6 months or longer were personally interviewed about any foot fracture that had occurred in 2014. Questionnaires were completed by every participant for data collection and quality control was accomplished by our research team members. The information included age, gender, height, weight, ethnic group, education, occupation, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleeping time per day, dietary habits and others. Fracture was initially identified by patients' self report and further confirmed by their providing medical records.
   Results
   A total of 512187 individuals participated in the CNFS. There were 201 patients with foot fractures in 2014. Mean age at the time of fracture was 45.4 years. The incidence rate of foot fractures was 39.2 (95%CI: 33.8-44.7)/100000/year. Fall and traffic accident were the most common causes for foot fractures and over 60% of these occurred at home or on the road. Alcohol consumption, history of previous fracture and average sleep time <7h/d were identified as independent risk factors for foot fractures both in males and females. Cigarette smoking was identified as a significant risk factor for foot fracture in males. For females, BMI >24 kg/m(2) was a risk factor whilst living in the west region was associated with a lower incidence rate of foot fracture.
   Conclusions
   The present study shows an incidence of 39.2/100000/year of foot fractures in China. Specific public health policies focusing on decreasing alcohol consumption and encouraging individuals to obtain sufficient sleep should be implemented. Females with a higher BMI should focus more on foot health care, especially in those with history of previous fracture.

TI Fitness cost of a mcr-1-carrying IncHI2 plasmid

ID CONJUGATIVE PLASMID; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; HOST-RANGE; EVOLUTION;
   RESISTANCE; ELEMENTS
AB IncHI2 is a common type of large mcr-1-carrying plasmids that have been found worldwide. Large plasmids could impose metabolic burden for host bacterial strains, we therefore examine the stability and fitness cost of a mcr-1-carrying 265.5-kb IncHI2 plasmid, pMCR1_1943, in Escherichia coli in nutrient-rich LB and nutrient-restricted M9 broth. Stability tests revealed that pMCR1_1943 was stably maintained with a stability frequency of 0.99 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- standard deviation) after 880 generations in LB and 0.97 +/- 0.00 after 220 generations in M9 broth. Relative fitness (expressed as w, defined as relative fitness of the plasmid-carrying strain compared to the plasmid-free progenitor strain) was examined using the 24-h head to head competitions. pMCR1_1943 initially imposed costs (w, 0.88 +/- 0.03 in LB, 0.87 +/- 0.01 in M9) but such costs were largely reduced after 14-day cultures (w, 0.97 +/- 0.03 in LB, 0.95 +/- 0.03 in M9). The stable maintenance and the largely compensated cost after passage may contribute to the wide spread of mcr-1-carrying IncHI2 plasmids. To investigate potential mechanisms for the reduced fitness cost, we performed whole genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism calling for the competitor strains. We identified that molecular chaperone-encoding dnaK, cell division protein-encoding cpoB and repeat protein-encoding rhsC were associated with the cost reduction for pMCR1_1943, which may represent new mechanisms for host bacterial strains to compensate fitness costs imposed by large plasmids and warrant further studies.

AB Urban and suburban landscapes can be refuges for biodiversity of bees and other pollinators. Public awareness of declining pollinator populations has increased interest in growing plants that provide floral resources for bees. Various publications and websites list "bee-friendly" plants, but such lists are rarely based on empirical data, nor do they emphasize flowering trees and shrubs, which are a major component of urban landscapes. We quantified bee visitation to 72 species of flowering woody landscape plants across 373 urban and suburban sites in Kentucky and southern Ohio, USA, sampling and identifying the bee assemblages associated with 45 of the most bee-attractive species. We found strong plant species effects and variation in seasonal activity of particular bee taxa, but no overall differences in extent of bee visitation or bee genus diversity between native and non-native species, trees and shrubs, or early-, mid-, and late-season blooming plants. Horticulturally-modified varieties of Hydrangea, Prunus, and Rosa with double petals or clusters of showy sterile sepals attracted few bees compared to related plants with more accessible floral rewards. Some of the non-native woody plant species bloomed when floral resources from native plants were scarce and were highly bee-attractive, so their use in landscapes could help extend the flowering season for bees. These data will help city foresters, landscape managers, and the public make informed decisions to create bee-friendly urban and suburban landscapes.

AB Managers need information about the vulnerability of historical plant communities, and their potential future conditions, to respond appropriately to landscape change driven by global climate change. We model the climate envelopes of plant communities on the Kenai Peninsula in Southcentral Alaska and forecast to 2020, 2050, and 2080. We assess 6 model outputs representing downscaled climate data from 3 global climate model outputs and 2 representative concentration pathways. We use two lines of evidence, model convergence and empirically measured rates of change, to identify the following plausible ecological trajectories for the peninsula: (1.) alpine tundra and sub-alpine shrub decrease, (2.) perennial snow and ice decrease, (3.) forests remain on the Kenai Lowlands, (4.) the contiguous white-Lutz-Sitka spruce complex declines, and (5.) mixed conifer afforestation occurs along the Gulf of Alaska coast. We suggest that converging models in the context of other lines of evidence is a viable approach to increase certainty for adaptation planning. Extremely dynamic areas with multiple outcomes (i.e., disagreement) among models represent ecological risk, but may also represent opportunities for facilitated adaptation and other managerial approaches to help tip the balance one way or another. By reducing uncertainty, this eclectic approach can be used to inform expectations about the future.

   ADHERENCE; HEALTH; MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; PREVENTION; STRATEGY
AB Background
   Health care innovations tailored to stakeholder context are more readily adopted. This study aimed to describe how Intervention Mapping (IM) was used to design health care innovations and how stakeholders were involved.
   Methods
   A scoping review was conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Science Citation Index were searched from 2008 to November 2017. English language studies that used or cited Intervention Mapping were eligible. Screening and data extraction were done in triplicate. Summary statistics were used to describe study characteristics, IM steps employed, and stakeholder involvement.
   Results
   A total of 852 studies were identified, 449 were unique, and 333 were excluded based on title and abstracts, 116 full-text articles were considered and 61 articles representing 60 studies from 13 countries for a variety of clinical issues were included. The number of studies published per year increased since 2008 and doubled in 2016 and 2017. The majority of studies employed multiple research methods (76.7%) and all 6 IM steps (73.3%). Resulting programs/interventions were single (55.4%) or multifaceted (46.4%), and 60.7% were pilot-tested. Programs or interventions were largely educational material or meetings, and were targeted to patients (70.2%), clinicians (14.0%) or both (15.8%). Studies provided few details about current or planned evaluation. Of the 4 (9.3%) studies that reported impact or outcomes, 3 achieved positive improvements in patient or professional behaviour or patient outcomes. Many studies (28.3%) did not involve stakeholders. Those that did (71.7%) often involved a combination of patients, clinicians, and community organizations. However, less than half (48.8%) described how they were engaged. Most often stakeholders were committee members and provide feedback on program or intervention content or format.
   Conclusions
   It is unclear if use of IM or stakeholder engagement in IM consistently results in effective programs or interventions. Those employing IM should report how stakeholders were involved in each IM step and how involvement influenced program or intervention design. They should also report the details or absence of planned evaluation. Future research should investigate how to optimize stakeholder engagement in IM, and whether use of IM itself or stakeholder engagement in IM are positively associated with effective programs or interventions.

AB Coordinated social behaviour is fundamental for ant ecological success. However, even distantly-related organisms, such as plants, have evolved the ability to manipulate ant collective performances to their own advantage. In the parasitic system encompassing Maculinea butterflies, Myrmica ants, and Origanum vulgare plants, the ant-plant interaction elicits the release of a volatile terpenoid compound (carvacrol) which is used by the gravid butterfly to locate the ideal oviposition site. Here we show that this ant-plant association is maintained by the effect of O. vulgare terpenoids on ant behaviour and that food plants might gain protection by Myrmica ants by chemically manipulating workers to forage in their surroundings. The variation in the locomotor ability of three ant species (Formica cinerea, Tetramorium caespitum, and Myrmica scabrinodis) was studied after treatment with the two major O. vulgare terpenoid volatile compounds (i.e., carvacrol and thymol). The brain levels of three biogenic amines (dopamine, tyramine and serotonin) were analysed in ants exposed to the O. vulgare terpenoids by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Carvacrol and thymol increased the locomotor activity of all ant species tested, but if blended reduced the movement propensity of Myrmica scabrinodis. Dopamine and tyramine production was positively correlated with the worker locomotor activity. In Myrmica ants, both brain biogenic ammines were negatively correlated with the aggressive behaviour. Blends of O. vulgare volatiles affected the locomotor ability while increased the aggressiveness of Myrmica workers by altering the aminergic regulation in the ant brains. This behavioural manipulation, might enhance partner fidelity and plant protection. Our findings provide new insights supporting a direct role of plant volatiles in driving behavioural changes in social insects through biogenic amine modulation.

AB Drought stress can imprint marks in plants after a previous exposure, leading to plant acclimation and a permissive state that facilitates a more effective response to subsequent stress events. Such stress imprints would benefit plants obtained through vegetative propagation (propagules). Herein, our hypothesis was that the propagules obtained from plants previously exposed to water deficit would perform better under water deficit as compared to those obtained from plants that did not face stressful conditions. Sugarcane plants were grown under well-hydrated conditions or subjected to three cycles of water deficit by water withholding. Then, the propagules were subjected to water deficit. Leaf gas exchange was reduced under water deficit and the propagules from plants that experienced water deficit presented a faster recovery of CO2 assimilation and higher instantaneous carboxylation efficiency after rehydration as compared to the propagules from plants that never faced water deficit. The propagules from plants that faced water deficit also showed the highest leaf proline concentration under water deficit as well as higher leaf H2O2 concentration and leaf ascorbate peroxidase activity regardless of water regime. Under well-watered conditions, the propagules from plants that faced stressful conditions presented higher root H2O2 concentration and higher activity of catalase in roots as compared to the ones from plants that did not experience water shortage. Such physiological changes were associated with improvements in leaf area and shoot and root dry matter accumulation in propagules obtained from stressed plants. Our results suggest that root H2O2 concentration is a chemical signal associated with improved sugarcane performance under water deficit. Taken together, our findings bring a new perspective to the sugarcane production systems, in which plant acclimation can be explored for improving drought tolerance in rainfed areas.

AB The genus Borrelia, originally described by Swellengrebel in 1907, contains tick- or louse-transmitted spirochetes belonging to the relapsing fever (RF) group of spirochetes, the Lyme borreliosis (LB) group of spirochetes and spirochetes that form intermittent clades. In 2014 it was proposed that the genus Borrelia should be separated into two genera; Borrelia Swellengrebel 1907 emend. Adeolu and Gupta 2014 containing RF spirochetes and Borreliella Adeolu and Gupta 2014 containing LB group of spirochetes. In this study we conducted an analysis based on a method that is suitable for bacterial genus demarcation, the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP). We included RF group species, LB group species and two species belonging to intermittent clades, Borrelia turcica Guner et al. 2004 and Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi Loh et al. 2017. These analyses convincingly showed that all groups of spirochetes belong into one genus and we propose to emend, and re-unite all groups in, the genus Borrelia.

AB Introduction
   Classic ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by early onset ataxia, immune deficiency, sino-pulmonary disease, lymphoid/solid malignancies and telangiectasias. Prior studies have suggested that chronic inflammation and premature aging may contribute to the development of malignancy and pulmonary disease in people with A-T. To further examine the link between A-T and inflammation, we hypothesized that subjects with classic A-T would have greater enrichment of inflammatory pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to non A-T age-matched controls. To test this hypothesis we used RNAseq as an unsupervised approach to identify biological processes altered in people with classic A-T.
   Methods
   PBMCs were isolated from subjects with classic A-T and compared to non-A-T age-matched healthy controls. RNAseq with differential gene expression analyses was then performed. Selected genes were validated by RT-qPCR using cohorts of subjects consisting of classic A-T, mild A-T or non-A-T controls. Subjects with mild A-T were characterized by later onset/mild neurologic features and normal/near normal immune status.
   Results
   RNAseq revealed 310 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including genes involved in inflammation, immune regulation, and cancer. Using gene set enrichment analysis, A-T subjects were found to have biological processes enriched for inflammatory and malignancy pathways. In examining a cohort of A-T subjects in which baseline serum IL8 and IL6 levels were measured previously, an association was found between higher serum IL8 levels and higher likelihood of developing malignancy and/or death in a subsequent 4-6 year period.
   Conclusion
   RNAseq using PBMCs from subjects with classic A-T uncovered differential expression of immune response genes and biological processes associated with inflammation, immune regulation, and cancer. Follow-up of A-T subjects over a 4-6 year period revealed an association between higher baseline serum IL8 levels and malignancy/death. These findings support a role for inflammation as a contributing factor in A-T phenotypes.

TI Raman spectroscopy of a near infrared absorbing proteorhodopsin:

AB Microbial rhodopsins have become an important tool in the field of optogenetics. However, effective in vivo optogenetics is in many cases severely limited due to the strong absorption and scattering of visible light by biological tissues. Recently, a combination of opsin sitedirected mutagenesis and analog retinal substitution has produced variants of proteorhodopsin which absorb maximally in the near-infrared (NIR). In this study, UV-Visible-NIR absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy were used to study the double mutant, D212N/F234S, of green absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR) regenerated with MMAR, a retinal analog containing a methylamino modified beta-ionone ring. Four distinct subcomponent absorption bands with peak maxima near 560, 620, 710 and 780 nm are detected with the NIR bands dominant at pH <7.3, and the visible bands dominant at pH 9.5. FT-Raman using 1064-nm excitation reveal two strong ethylenic bands at 1482 and 1498 cm(-1) corresponding to the NIR subcomponent absorption bands based on an extended linear correlation between lambda(max) and gamma(C = C). This spectrum exhibits two intense bands in the fingerprint and HOOP mode regions that are highly characteristic of the O-640 photointermediate from the light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin photocycle. In contrast, 532-nm excitation enhances the 560-nm component, which exhibits bands very similar to light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin and/or the acid-purple form of bacteriorhodopsin. Native GPR and its mutant D97N when regenerated with MMAR also exhibit similar absorption and Raman bands but with weaker contributions from the NIR absorbing components. Based on these results it is proposed that the NIR absorption in GPR-D212N/F234S with MMAR arises from an O-like chromophore, where the Schiff base counterion D97 is protonated and the MMAR adopts an all-trans configuration with a non-planar geometry due to twists in the conjugated polyene segment. This configuration is characterized by extensive charge delocalization, most likely involving nitrogens atoms in the MMAR chromophore.

AB Dietary macronutrient composition alters metabolism through several mechanisms, including post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins. To connect diet and molecular changes, here we performed short-and long-term feeding of mice with standard chow diet (SCD) and high-fat diet (HFD), with or without glucose or fructose supplementation, and quantified liver metabolites, 861 proteins, and 1,815 protein level-corrected mitochondrial acetylation and succinylation sites. Nearly half the acylation sites were altered by at least one diet; nutrient-specific changes in protein acylation sometimes encompass entire pathways. Although acetyl-CoA is an intermediate in both sugar and fat metabolism, acetyl-CoA had a dichotomous fate depending on its source; chronic feeding of dietary sugars induced protein hyperacetylation, whereas the same duration of HFD did not. Instead, HFD resulted in citrate accumulation, anaplerotic metabolism of amino acids, and protein hypo-succinylation. Together, our results demonstrate novel connections between dietary macronutrients, protein post-translational modifications, and regulation of fuel selection in liver.

AB Poison frogs acquire chemical defenses from the environment for protection against potential predators. These defensive chemicals are lipophilic alkaloids that are sequestered by poison frogs from dietary arthropods and stored in skin glands. Despite decades of research focusing on identifying poison frog alkaloids, we know relatively little about how environmental variation and subsequent arthropod availability impacts alkaloid loads in poison frogs. We investigated how seasonal environmental variation influences poison frog chemical profiles through changes in the diet of the Climbing Mantella (Mantella laevigata). We collected M. laevigata females on the Nosy Mangabe island reserve in Madagascar during the wet and dry seasons and tested the hypothesis that seasonal differences in rainfall is associated with changes in diet composition and skin alkaloid profiles of M. laevigata. The arthropod diet of each frog was characterized into five groups (i.e. ants, termites, mites, insect larvae, or 'other') using visual identification and cytochrome oxidase 1 DNA barcoding. We found that frog diet differed between the wet and dry seasons, where frogs had a more diverse diet in the wet season and consumed a higher percentage of ants in the dry season. To determine if seasonality was associated with variation in frog defensive chemical composition, we used gas chromatography / mass spectrometry to quantify alkaloids from individual skin samples. Although the assortment of identified alkaloids was similar across seasons, we detected significant differences in the abundance of certain alkaloids, which we hypothesize reflects seasonal variation in the diet of M. laevigata. We suggest that these variations could originate from seasonal changes in either arthropod leaf litter composition or changes in frog behavioral patterns. Although additional studies are needed to understand the consequences of long-term environmental shifts, this work suggests that alkaloid profiles are relatively robust against short-term environmental perturbations.

TI Statistical resolutions for large variabilities in hair mineral analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRACE-ELEMENTS; SCALP HAIR; REFERENCE VALUES; HEALTH; BLOOD
AB Measuring biomaterials is usually subject to error. Measurement errors are classified into either random errors or biases. Random errors can be well controlled using appropriate statistical methods. But, biases due to unknown, unobserved, or temporary causes, may lead to biased conclusions. This study describes a verification method to examine whether measurement errors are random or not and to determine efficient statistical methods.
   A number of studies have dealt with associations between hair minerals and exposures such as health, dietary or environmental conditions. Most review papers, however, emphasize the necessity for validation of hair mineral measurements, since large variations can cause highly variable results. To address these issues, we answer the following questions:
   1. How can we ascertain the reliability of measurements?
   2. How can we assess and control the variability of measurements?
   3. How do we efficiently determine associations between hair minerals and exposures?
   4. How can we concisely present the reference values?
   Since hair minerals all have distinctive natures, it would be unproductive to examine each mineral individually to find significant and consistent answers that apply to all minerals. To surmount this difficulty, we used one simple model for all minerals to explore quantitative answers. Hair mineral measurements of six-year-old children were analyzed based on the statistical model. The analysis verified that most of the measurements were reliable, and their inter-individual variations followed two-parameter distributions. These results allow for sophisticated study designs and efficient statistical methods to examine the effects of various kinds of exposures on hair minerals.

TI Barriers and facilitators to the uptake of Test and Treat in Mozambique:
   A qualitative study on patient and provider perceptions

AB Background
   In mid-2016, Mozambique began phased implementation of the 'Test-and-Treat' policy, which enrolls HIV positive clients into antiretroviral treatment (ART) immediately regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage. Novel insights into barriers and facilitators to ART initiation among healthy clients are needed to improve implementation of Test and Treat.
   Methods and findings
   A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted across 10 health facilities in Mozambique. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with HIV-positive clients (60 who initiated/20 who did not initiate ART within Test and Treat) and 9 focus group discussion (FGDs) were conducted with health care workers (HCWs; n = 53). Data were analyzed using deductive and inductive analysis strategies. Barriers to ART initiation included: (1) feeling 'healthy'; (2) not prepared to start ART for life; (3) concerns about ART side effects; (4) fear of HIV disclosure and discrimination; (5) poor interactions with HCWs; (6) limited privacy at health facilities; and (7) perceptions of long wait times. Facilitators included the motivation to stay healthy and to take care of dependents, as well as new models of ART services such as adaptation of counseling to clients' specific needs, efficient patient flow, and integrated HIV/primary care services.
   Conclusions
   ART initiation may be difficult for healthy clients in the context of Test-and-Treat. Specific strategies to engage this population are needed. Strategies could include targeted support for clients, community sensitization on the benefits of early ART initiation, client-centered approaches to patient care, and improved efficiency through multi-month scripting and increased workforce.

TI The effect of breed-specific dog legislation on hospital treated dog
   bites in Odense, Denmark-A time series intervention study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEMOGRAPHY; INJURIES; CHILDREN
AB As dog bite injuries are a considerable problem in modern society, in order to reduce such injuries, breed-specific legislation has been introduced in a number of countries. Whilst many studies have shown a lack of effect with such legislation, the commonly used methodology is known to be flawed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the Danish breed-specific legislation on the number of dog bite injuries using more credible methods. A time series intervention method was used on a detailed dataset from Odense University Hospital, Denmark, regarding dog bite injuries presented to the emergency department. The results indicate that banning certain breeds has a highly limited effect on the overall levels of dog bite injuries, and that an enforcement of the usage of muzzle and leash in public places for these breeds also has a limited effect. Despite using more credible and sound methods, this study supports previous studies showing that breed-specific legislation seems to have no effect on dog bite injuries. In order to minimise dog bite injuries in the future, it would seem that other interventions or non-breed-specific legislation should be considered as the primary option.

AB Introduction
   The safety of using GBCAs to enhance the visibility of body structures is currently discussed due to possible gadolinium retention in brain structures. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of multiple exposures to macrocyclic GBCAs in children.
   Materials and methods
   This retrospective, single-center study included data from 43 patients who had received. 4 injections of macrocyclic GBCAs during MRI examinations over performed over 8 to 84 months. Signal intensity was measured on unenhanced T1-weighted MRI, and globus pallidus to thalamus (GP/Th) and dentate nucleus to pons (DN/P) ratios were calculated. The differences in ratios were tested with the Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. For categorical data, Pearson's chi-squared test was used. Relationships were analyzed with the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
   Results
   Patients with the mean age of 7.5 years (SD = 4.2) received 8.19 (SD = 3.63) injections of GBCAs on average. Differences in GP/Th and DN/P ratios between the first and the last measurement were insignificant. Children before the end of myelination process (<= 2 years of age) had the first GP/Th ratio values significantly lower than those >2 years of age (p = 0.0284), which than increased at the final scan and reached the level similar to values obtained in the group of >2 years of age.
   Conclusions
   Maturation of the brain may affect both signal intensity of brain structures and susceptibility to GBCAs; thus, assessment of signal intensity of the brain structures should be conducted taking into account the age of a child.

TI Establishment of a conditional TALEN system using the translational
   enhancer dMac3 and an inducible promoter activated by glucocorticoid
   treatment to increase the frequency of targeted mutagenesis in plants
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GENOME; GENE; NUCLEASES; SITES; TOOLS
AB Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) is an artificial nuclease that causes DNA cleavage at the target site and induces few off-target reactions because of its high sequence specificity. Powerful and variable tools using TALENs can be used in practical applications and may facilitate the molecular breeding of many plant species. We have developed a convenient construction system for a plant TALEN vector named the Emerald Gateway TALEN system. In this study, we added new properties to this system, which led to an increase in the efficiency of targeted mutagenesis. Rice dMac3 is a translational enhancer that highly increases the efficiency of translation of the downstream ORF. We inserted dMac3 into the 5' untranslated region of the TALEN gene. In the cultured rice cells to which the TALEN gene was introduced, the frequency of targeted mutagenesis was highly increased compared with those altered using the conventional system. Next, the promoter for the TALEN gene was replaced with iPromoter, and its expression was stringently controlled by a GVG transcription factor that was activated in the presence of glucocorticoid. This conditional expression system worked effectively and led to a higher frequency of targeted mutagenesis than that by the constitutive expression system, while no mutagenesis was detected without glucocorticoid treatment. These results suggest that our system can be applied to genome editing to create the desired mutation.

TI Seismic site classification and amplification of shallow bedrock sites
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SHEAR-WAVE VELOCITY; SPECTRA; MOTION; DEPTH
AB This study attempts to develop empirical correlations between average penetration resistance ((NSPT-R) over bar), averaged velocities over depth up to bedrock depth ((VS-R) over bar) and 30 m ((V-S30) over bar) for shallow depth sites (having bedrock at a depth less than 25 m). A total of 63 shallow sites were assessed for penetration resistance values up to the bedrock from Standard Penetration Tests (SPT) and dynamic soil property analysis, i.e., Shear Wave Velocity (V-S) from Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves. The study shows that 30 m averaged shear wave velocities are more than the average velocity up to bedrock depth in shallow bedrock sites because of inclusion of rock site velocity. Furthermore, averaged SPT-N((NSPT-R) over bar) and average V-S ((VS-R) over bar) up to bedrock depth were correlated with the 30 m average((V-S30) over bar) values. This is the first attempt in developing empirical relationships of this kind for seismic site classification. These correlations can be made useful for seismic site classification of sites in regions with Standard Penetration Test (N-SPT) values and limited V-S values. Further surface and bedrock motion recordings of 12 selected KiK-net shallow depth sites were collected and amplifications were estimated with the respective peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration and thereby related to the average shear wave velocity up to bedrock and 30 m. The results show that the amplification is better correlated to the (VS-R) over bar than (V-S30) over bar for shallow depth sites, and more data can be added to strengthen this correlation.

AB We investigated the feasibility of low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), using a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered axial scan protocol, knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR), and fixed tube current, in overweight subjects. Forty non-overweight (group A; body-mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m(2)) and 40 overweight individuals (group B; BMI = 25-30 kg/m(2)), who underwent CCTA for coronary artery disease screening, were retrospectively and consecutively enrolled. A 64-slice CT scanner was used at 100-kVp tube voltage and 150-mA tube current, and images were reconstructed using IMR techniques. Image noise, attenuation at the aorta, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the proximal right and left main coronary arteries (pRCA and LMCA) were calculated. CCTA images were qualitatively evaluated using a four-point scale (1, poor; 4, excellent) and analyzed using a non-inferiority test with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -0.2. The mean CCTA radiation dose (Group A: 1.33 +/- 0.02 mSv; Group B: 1.35 +/- 0.10 mSv; p = 0.151) and mean aortic root CT attenuation values (Group A: 447.9 +/- 81.6 HU; Group B: 439.5 +/- 63.6 HU; p = 0.571) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean noise in groups A and B was 26.0 +/- 4.8 HU and 29.2 +/- 4.4 HU, respectively (p = 0.005). The noise reduction ratio in the groups, compared to filtered back projection, was 65.0% and 68.1%, respectively. The mean grade of image quality did not differ significantly (3.75 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.04, p = 0.478). Group B CCTA image quality was non-inferior (mean difference = -0.043, 95% CI = -0.162-0.077) to that of Group A. We concluded that low-dose CCTA with prospective ECG-triggering and IMR might be applied to overweight subjects, as well as to normal-weight subjects, by using a fixed tube current without an increase in tube current based on the patient's body size.

AB Background
   Little is known about heart diseases and their treatment in rural sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to describe the occurrence, characteristics, and etiologies of heart diseases, and the medication taken before and prescribed after echocardiography in a rural referral Hospital in Tanzania.
   Methods
   This prospective descriptive cohort study included all adults and children referred for echocardiography. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collated for analysis.
   Results
   From December 2015 to October 2017, a total of 1'243 echocardiograms were performed. A total of 815 adults and 59 children. 15 years had abnormal echocardiographic findings; in adults 537/815 (66%) had hypertension, with 230/537(43%) on antihypertensive drugs, and 506/815 (62%) were not on regular cardiac medication; 346/815 (42%) had severe eccentric or concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and 182/815 (22%) had severe systolic heart failure. Only 44% demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function. The most frequent heart diseases were hypertensive heart disease (41%), valvular heart disease (18%), coronary heart disease (18%), peripartum cardiomyopathy (7%), and other non-hypertensive dilated cardiomyopathies (6%) in adults, and congenital heart disease (34%) in children. Following echocardiography, 802/815 (98%) adults and 40/59 (68%) children had an indication for cardiac medication, 70/815 (9%) and 2/59 (3%) for oral anticoagulation, and 35/815 (4%) and 23/59 (39%) for cardiac surgery, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Hypertension is the leading etiology of heart diseases in rural Tanzania. Most patients present with advanced stages of heart disease, and the majority are not treated before echocardiography. There is an urgent need for increased awareness, expertise and infrastructure to detect and treat hypertension and heart failure in rural Africa.

TI Morphological diversity in the foraminiferal genus Marginopora
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY
AB Benthic foraminifera, and certainly symbiont-bearing (large) benthic foraminifera are generally considered to have large geographic ranges in combination with significant ecomorphological variation. With the advance of molecular phylogenetic approaches, supported or preceded by detailed morphological studies, it was demonstrated that this view needs to be reevaluated. In this paper I evaluate the morphology of five Marginopora populations from around the Coral Sea by microCT-scanning. I argue that ecomorphological and ontogenetic variation is smaller than geographic variation in morphology. This forms the basis for the description of three new species, M. santoensis nov. spec., M. charlottensis nov. spec., M. orpheusensis nov. spec. Quantitative morphological variation between M. rossi, M. orpheusensis nov. spec. and M. charlottensis nov. spec. is overlapping, but each species has unique morphological characters supporting recognition as new species. Support to distinguish the deep living (M. rossi, M. charlottensis nov. spec., M. orpheusensis nov. spec.) and shallow living (M. vertebralis) Marginopora populations as separate species is strong, but not enough molecular phylogenetic data are available to test the three new deep-living species on the Great Barrier Reef hypothesis. However, detailed understanding of ecophenotypic variation in M. santoensis nov. spec. supports the conclusion that it is unlikely that ecophenotypic variation can explain the morphological variation between the three species. I argue that the number of species in this genus is underestimated, and that there are at least five species in the Coral Sea area alone.

AB Background
   Exercise capacity is an important feature in patients with COPD. Its impairment drives disability and dependency for daily activities performance. This study evaluated the six years change in exercise capacity in subjects with airflow obstruction and compared this to subjects without airflow obstruction, with and without a smoking history.
   Methods
   Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) were repeatedly performed during a six years follow up period. Peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)peak), work rate (WRpeak), heart rate (HRpeak), minute ventilation (VEpeak), respiratory exchange ratio (RERpeak) and ventilatory reserve (VE/MVV) were collected as effort dependent outcomes. The slopes of oxygen uptake, ventilatory and mechanical efficiency (OUES, Delta VE/Delta VCO2 and Delta VO2/Delta WR) were collected as effort independent outcomes.
   Results
   One hundred and thirty-eight subjects were included. Thirty-eight presented airflow obstruction (63 +/- 6 years, 74% men, FEV1 90 +/- 15%(pred)), 44 had a smoking history but no airflow obstruction (61 +/- 5 years, 61% men, FEV1 105 +/- 15%(pred)) and 56 had never smoked (61 +/- 7 years, 57% men, FEV1 117 +/- 18%(pred)). At baseline, the airflow obstruction group had slightly worse exercise capacity in comparison to the never smoking control group, in absolute terms and expressed as percentage of the predicted value (VO(2)peak = 27 +/- 5 versus 32 +/- 8 ml/min/kg, p<0.01; 112 +/- 29 versus 130 +/- 33%(pred), p = 0.04). Most exercise variables showed a statistically significant yearly deterioration, with exception of VE/MVV, Delta VE/Delta VCO2 and Delta VO2/Delta WR. The yearly decline in VO(2)peak and OUES was not faster in subjects with airflow obstruction than in smoking and never smoking controls (VO(2)peak -67 (9) versus -76 (9) ml/min, p = 0.44 and versus -58 (9), p = 0.47; OUES -32 (11) versus -68 (10), p = 0.03 and versus -68 (13), p = 0.03).
   Conclusions
   With exception of VO(2)peak, effort dependent variables deteriorated faster in subjects with airflow obstruction compared to never smoking controls. The deterioration of effort independent variables, however, was not accelerated in the airflow obstruction group compared to controls.

AB Since the use of language is a core aspect of psychotherapy, its study requires instruments that allow for further research. The aim of this study is to present an observational instrument capable of analyzing the language used in psychotherapeutic settings, both by therapists and clients. The SICOLENTE instrument was applied to two different samples: The Three Approaches to Psychotherapy film and a naturalistic sample. 7710 utterances from 31 sessions (three from the demonstration film and 28 from a naturalistic setting) were coded. Two studies were conducted: in the first study, inter and intra coder reliability (dimension and category levels) and Generalizability theory analyzes were assessed, whilst in the second study, construct validity was tested with several hypotheses. The final instrument resulted in 20 categories with three dimensions: Conversational Act (7 categories), Therapeutic topic (6 categories) and Content (7 categories). The three dimensions showed excellent inter and intra coder reliability and the generalizability coefficients were excellent. Out of the 24 validity hypothesis proposed, 19 were accepted. The finding suggests that the SICOLENTE is a reliable and valid instrument that can be applied to investigate the performance of various theoretical models. Its three dimensional structure gives it the flexibility to be able to carry out macroscopic or microscopic language research.

TI Efp promotes in vitro and in vivo growth of endometrial cancer cells

AB Endometrial cancer is common among postmenopausal women and its incidence is increasing in developed countries. Considering that >80% of endometrial cancers are assumed to be estrogen-related, higher estrogen exposure will be relevant to tumorigenesis. Therefore, the roles of estrogen target genes will be important to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms. We previously revealed that estrogen-responsive RING finger protein Efp contributes to breast cancer progression through the protein degradation of cell cycle checkpoint 14-3-3 sigma. We and others also proposed that Efp has tumor-promoting activities in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cancer cells. In addition, Efp plays a role in type I interferon production by activating antiviral signaling, which provokes nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling. In the present study, we investigate whether Efp plays a critical role in endometrial cancer biology. We show that siRNA-mediated Efp knockdown represses the proliferation and migration of endometrial cancer ER-positive Ishikawa and ER-negative HEC-1A cells. Efp knockdown increases 14-3-3 sigma protein levels and decreases the rates proliferative stage cells. Efp siRNA significantly inhibits the in vivo tumor growth of endometrial cancer cells in both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models. Intriguingly, Efp knockdown represses NF-kappa B-dependent transactivation and transcription of target genes, such as IL6ST and IL18, in endometrial cancer cells. Overall, Efp would exert a tumor-promoting role through modulating NF-kappa B pathway and 14-3-3 sigma protein degradation in endometrial cancer regardless of its estrogen receptor status. Our results indicate that Efp could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for endometrial cancer.

DT Article
ID RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; PNEUMOTHORAX; TUMORS; DIAGNOSIS; SPECTRUM; RISK
AB Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHDS) is a genetic tumor syndrome characterized by lung cysts, pneumothorax, fibrofolliculomas and renal cell cancer. The diagnosis of BHDS is usually considered if kidney cancer occurs before age 50 years, is multifocal and/or bilateral or of the oncocytoma/hybrid oncocytoma-chromophobe type. Using a sample of 50 BHDS families with a total of 178 patients we analyzed how many kidney cancer patients fulfilled one or more of these criteria. Furthermore, we addressed the question if genotype-phenotype-correlations exist that can be used for risk stratification. Renal cell cancer occurred in 34/178 (19.1%) patients, and the reported male bias was not observed. Furthermore, most kidney malignancies occurred after the age of 50 years. Thus, the majority of tumors did not show the typical hallmarks of BHDS. A below-average tumor frequency (17.2%) was observed for the known mutational hotspot c.1285delC/dupC that was the cause of BHDS in 24% of families. Unexpected was the high tumor frequency (66.7%) associated with mutation c.887C>G within a single family, a finding that merits further exploration.

AB Introduction
   A significant population of our wounded veterans suffer long-term functional consequences of visual deficit, disorientation, dizziness, and an impaired ability to read. These symptoms may be related to damage within the otolith pathways that contribute to ocular alignment. The purpose of this study was to compare perception of vertical and torsional ocular alignment between veterans and healthy controls in an upright and supine test position.
   Materials and methods
   Veterans (n = 26) with reports of dizziness were recruited from the East Orange Veterans Administration Hospital. Healthy controls (n = 26) were recruited from both Johns Hopkins University and the East Orange VA. Each subject performed 20 trials each of a novel vertical and torsional binocular alignment perception test. Veterans underwent semicircular canal and otolith pathway function testing.
   Results
   88% of the Veterans had an absent otolith response. Only the veterans had an abnormally large variability in perception of both vertical and torsional ocular alignment, and in both upright and supine position. Neither post-traumatic stress disorder, nor depression contributed to the misperception in binocular alignment.
   Conclusions
   Our novel method of measuring vertical and torsional misalignment distinguishes veterans with dizziness from healthy controls. The high prevalence of absent otolith function seems to explain this result. Further studies are needed to better understand the fundamental mechanism responsible for the increased variability of perception of binocular alignment.

TI Differential role of a persistent seed bank for genetic variation in
   early vs. late successional stages
SO PLOS ONE

   CONSEQUENCES; GRASSLAND; FRAGMENTATION; CLEISTOGAMY
AB Persistent seed banks are predicted to have an important impact on population genetic processes by increasing effective population size and storing past genetic diversity. Accordingly, persistent seed banks may buffer genetic effects of disturbance, fragmentation and/or selection. However, empirical studies surveying the relationship between aboveground and seed bank genetics under changing environments are scarce. Here, we compared genetic variation of aboveground and seed bank cohorts in 15 populations of the partially cleistogamous Viola elatior in two contrasting early and late successional habitats characterized by strong differences in light-availability and declining population size. Using AFLP markers, we found significantly higher aboveground than seed bank genetic diversity in early successional meadow but not in late successional woodland habitats. Moreover, individually, three of eight woodland populations even showed higher seed bank than aboveground diversity. Genetic differentiation among populations was very strong ((ST) = 0.8), but overall no significant differentiation could be detected between above ground and seed bank cohorts. Small scale spatial genetic structure was generally pronounced but was much stronger in meadow (Sp-statistic: aboveground: 0.60, seed bank: 0.32) than in woodland habitats (aboveground: 0.11; seed bank: 0.03). Our findings indicate that relative seed bank diversity (i.e. compared to aboveground diversity) increases with ongoing succession and despite decreasing population size. As corroborated by markedly lower small-scale genetic structure in late successional habitats, we suggest that the observed changes in relative seed bank diversity are driven by an increase of outcrossing rates. Persistent seed banks in Viola elatior hence will counteract effects of drift and selection, and assure a higher chance for the species' long term persistence, particularly maintaining genetic variation in declining populations of late successional habitats and thus enhancing success rates of population recovery after disturbance events.

   INTERNET; PREDICTORS; SYMPTOMS; DEMANDS
AB Most studies report a positive relationship of work engagement with health and job performance, but, occasionally, a "dark side of engagement" has also been uncovered. The current study examined two hypotheses: whether work engagement has (1) a U-shaped curvilinear relation with psychological distress and (2) an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relation with job performance (i.e., in-role performance and creative behavior). A two-wave longitudinal Internet survey with a time lag of seven months was conducted among 1,967 Japanese employees. To test our hypotheses, we used a two-wave panel design and examined the lagged and concurrent relations between work engagement and both outcomes. The results confirmed that work engagement had a curvilinear relation with psychological distress concurrently; a favorable effect was found initially, but this disappeared at intermediate levels of work engagement, and, at higher levels, an adverse effect became prominent. In addition, work engagement had a curvilinear relation with in-role performance both concurrently and longitudinally; the higher the levels of work engagement, the stronger the favorable effects on in-role performance. However, contrary to our expectations, work engagement had a linear relation with psychological distress longitudinally and with creative behavior both concurrently and longitudinally. Hence, our results suggest that work engagement plays a different role in health enhancement compared to performance enhancement. Leveling-off and adverse effects of high work engagement were observed for psychological distress in the short and not in a long run. In contrast, no leveling-off effect of high work engagement was observed for job performance. Thus, except for the short-term effect on psychological distress, no dark side of work engagement was observed for psychological distress and job performance.

TI Theories of God: Explanatory coherence in religious cognition
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INTUITIONS; KNOWLEDGE
AB Representations of God in art, literature, and discourse range from the highly anthropomorphic to the highly abstract. The present study explored whether people who endorse anthropomorphic God concepts hold different religious beliefs and engage in different religious practices than those who endorse abstract concepts. Adults of various religious affiliations (n = 275) completed a questionnaire that probed their beliefs about God, angels, Satan, Heaven, Hell, cosmogenesis, anthropogenesis, human suffering, and human misdeeds, as well as their experiences regarding prayer, worship, and religious development. Responses to the questionnaire were analyzed by how strongly participants anthropomorphized God in a property-attribution task. Overall, the more participants anthropomorphized God, the more concretely they interpreted religious ideas, importing their understanding of human affairs into their understanding of divine affairs. These findings suggest not only that individuals vary greatly in how they interpret the same religious ideas but also that those interpretations cohere along a concrete-to-abstract dimension, anchored on the concrete side by our everyday notions of people.

   IDENTIFICATION; RECOMBINATION
AB Positive-strand RNA viruses generally assemble RNA replication complexes on rearranged host membranes. Alphaviruses, other members of the alpha-like virus superfamily, and many other positive-strand RNA viruses invaginate host membrane into vesicular RNA replication compartments, known as spherules, whose interior is connected to the cytoplasm. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) and its close relative, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), form spherules along the endoplasmic reticulum. BMV spherule formation and RNA replication can be fully reconstituted in S. cerevisiae, enabling many studies identifying host factors and viral interactions essential for these processes. To better define and understand the conserved, core pathways of bromovirus RNA replication, we tested the ability of CCMV to similarly support spherule formation and RNA replication in yeast. Paralleling BMV, we found that CCMV RNA replication protein 1a was the only viral factor necessary to induce spherule membrane rearrangements and to recruit the viral 2a polymerase (2a(pol)) to the endoplasmic reticulum. CCMV 1a and 2a(pol) also replicated CCMV and BMV genomic RNA2, demonstrating core functionality of CCMV 1a and 2a(pol) in yeast. However, while BMV and CCMV 1a/2a(pol) strongly replicate each others' genomic RNA3 in plants, neither supported detectable CCMV RNA3 replication in yeast. Moreover, in contrast to plant cells, in yeast CCMV 1a/2a(pol) supported only limited replication of BMV RNA3 (<5% of that by BMV 1a/2a(pol)). In keeping with this, we found that in yeast CCMV 1a was significantly impaired in recruiting BMV or CCMV RNA3 to the replication complex. Overall, we show that many 1a and 2a(pol) functions essential for replication complex assembly, and their ability to be reconstituted in yeast, are conserved between BMV and CCMV. However, restrictions of CCMV RNA replication in yeast reveal previously unknown 1a-linked, RNA-selective host contributions to the essential early process of recruiting viral RNA templates to the replication complex.

TI Imaging and quantitative analysis of insecticide in mosquito net fibers
   using Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID WASH RESISTANCE; OLYSET(R) NET; POLYMERS; EFFICACY
AB Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the distribution of permethrin insecticide on the surfaces and interiors of Olyset long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) fibers. Total insecticide content in LLINs has been established using many analytical methods. However, it is important to quantify the bioavailable portion residing on the fiber surfaces for incorporated LLINs. ToF-SIMS is a very surface sensitive technique and can directly image the spatial distribution of permethrin insecticide on the surface of Olyset fibers. Surface permethrin appeared as patchy deposits which were easily removed by acetone and reappeared after several days as interior permethrin migrated (bloomed) from the fiber interior. After a wash/incubation cycle, permethrin deposits were more diffuse and less concentrated than those on the as-received fibers. ToF-SIMS is particularly sensitive to detect the Cl- ion, which is the characteristic ion of permethrin. Ion implantation and quantification of dopants using SIMS is well established in the semiconductor industry. In this study, quantitative depth profiling was carried out using 35 Cl- ion implantation to correlate secondary ion yield with permethrin concentration, yielding a limit of detection of 0.051 wt% for permethrin. In some cases, surface concentration differed greatly from the fiber interior (>1 mu m below the surface). Two-and three-dimensional mapping of Cl at sub-micrometer resolution showed permethrin to be dissolved throughout the fiber, with about 2 vol% residing in disperse, high-concentration domains. This suggests that these fibers fall into the class of monolithic sustained-release devices. It is expected that ToF-SIMS can be a valuable tool to provide insight into the insecticide release behavior of other LLIN products, both current and future.

AB Introduction
   Clinicians and patients face a daunting task when choosing the most appropriate probiotic for their specific needs. Available preparations encompass a diverse and continuously expanding product base, with most available products lacking evidence-based trials that support their use. Even when evidence exists, not all probiotic products are equally effective for all disease prevention or treatment indications. At this point in time, drug regulatory agencies offer limited assistance with regard to guidance and oversight in most countries, including the U.S.
   Methods
   We reviewed the current medical literature and sources on the internet to survey the types of available probiotic products and to determine which probiotics had evidence-based efficacy data. Standard medical databases from inception to June 2018 were searched and discussions with experts in the field were conducted. We graded the strength of the evidence for probiotics having multiple, randomized controlled trials and developed a guide for the practical selection of current probiotic products for specific uses.
   Results
   We found the efficacy of probiotic products is both strain-specific and disease-specific. Important factors involved in choosing the appropriate probiotic include matching the strain(s) with the targeted disease or condition, type of formulation, dose used and the source (manufacturing quality control and shelf-life). While we found many probiotic products lacked confirmatory trials, we found sufficient evidence for 22 different types of probiotics from 249 trials to be included. For example, several types of probiotics had strong evidence for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea [Saccharomyces boulardii I-745, a three-strain mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, L. casei Lbc80r, L. rhamnosus CLR2) and L. casei DN114001]. Strong evidence was also found for four types of probiotics for the prevention of a variety of other diseases/conditions (enteral-feed associated diarrhea, travellers' diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolits and side-effects associated with H. pylori treatments. The evidence was most robust for the treatment of pediatric acute diarrhea based on 59 trials (7 types of probiotics have strong efficacy), while an eight-strain multi-strain mixture showed strong efficacy for inflammatory bowel disease and two types of probiotics had strong efficacy for irritable bowel disease. Of the 22 types of probiotics reviewed, 15 (68%) had strong-moderate evidence for efficacy for at least one type of disease.
   Conclusion
   The choice of an appropriate probiotic is multi-factored, based on the mode and type of disease indication and the specific efficacy of probiotic strain(s), as well as product quality and formulation.

These networks may be geographically structured; the links among the species of a local network are shaped by the biotic composition of the community, thus creating selection mosaics at broader geographical scales. Therefore, to fully understand a coevolutionary process, it is crucial to visualize the geographical structure of the interaction network across the landscape. In this study we focused on the poorly known interaction system between Ensifera ensifera and its guild of long-flowered plant species. We combined occurrence data and environmental variables to predict E. ensifera distribution, in addition to range polygons available for plant species in order to evaluate the geographical variation in bill length and plant species richness. A positive relationship between bill length and plant species richness within the E. ensifera range suggests a geographical structuring of the interaction networks. At mid-latitude locations of E. ensifera range, where hummingbirds attained the longest bills, richness of long-flowered plant species was higher than at low latitude locations. These locations likely represent coevolutionary vortices where long-lasting reciprocal selection probably drove the evolution of long traits, consequently drawing new plant species into the coevolutionary network. Conversely, areas where the sword-billed hummingbird was absent or had shorter bills probably represent coevolutionary coldspots. Our results provide a first insight into this phenotypically specialized plant-pollinator network across the landscape and show candidate areas to test the predictions of the coevolutionary hypothesis, such as reciprocal selection.

AB Importance
   This study provides a nationwide, population-based data on the incidence of benign essential blepharospasm in Asian adults.
   Background
   To describe the incidence, patient demographics, and risk factors associated with benign essential blepharospasm.
   Design
   Population-based retrospective study.
   Participants and samples
   A total of 1325 patients with benign essential blepharospasm were identified.
   Methods Patients with diagnosis of blepharopsasm between January 2000 and December 2013 were sampled using the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Secondary blepharospasm that may be related to neurological, trauma, and ocular surface disease were excluded.
   Main outcome measured
   Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for potential risk factors of benign essential blepharospasm.
   Results
   The mean annual incidence was 0.10% (0.07% for males, and 0.12% for females). The peak incidence was in the 50 to 59-year-old age group (0.19%). People living in urban regions have more risk of developing blepharospasm comparing to people living in less urban regions (p < 0.01). White-collar workers also have higher chance of having blepharospasm (p<0.001). Significant difference between control group and case group in hyperlipidemia (p <0.001), sleep disorders (p <0.001), mental disorders (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder) (p <0.001), dry eye-related diseases (dry eye, Sjogren's syndrome) (p < 0.001), Parkinson's disease (p <0.004), and rosacea (p <0.021) were also identified.
   Conclusions and relevance
   Higher level of urbanization, white-collar work, sleep disorders, mental health diseases, dry eye-related diseases, Parkinsonism, and rosacea are possible risk factors for benign essential blepharospasm.

AB Oral administration of hydrogen water ameliorates Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats, mice, and humans. We previously reported that the number of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria in intestinal microbiota is low in PD compared to controls. We also reported that the amount of hydrogen produced by ingestion of lactulose is low in PD patients. The decreased hydrogen production by intestinal microbiota may be associated with the development and progression of PD. We measured the amount of hydrogen production using gas chromatography by seven bacterial strains, which represented seven major intestinal bacterial groups/genera/species. Blautia coccoides and Clostridium leptum produced the largest amount of hydrogen. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis constituted the second group that produced hydrogen 34- to 93-fold lower than B. coccoides. Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Atopobium parvulum constituted the third group that produced hydrogen 559- to 2164-fold lower than B. coccoides. Lactobacillus casei produced no detectable hydrogen. Assuming that taxonomically neighboring strains have similar hydrogen production, we simulated hydrogen production using intestinal microbiota that we previously reported, and found that PD patients produce a 2.2-fold lower amount of intestinal hydrogen compared to controls. The lower amount of intestinal hydrogen production in PD was also simulated in cohorts of two other countries. The number of hydrogen-producing intestinal bacteria may be associated with the development and progression of PD. Further studies are required to prove its beneficial effect.

TI Rapid birth-death evolution and positive selection in
   detoxification-type glutathione S-transferases in mammals
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PROCESSED PSEUDOGENES; GENES; IDENTIFICATION; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION;
   REDUCTASE; RESIDUES; ENZYME; SITES
AB Glutathione S-Transferases (GSTs) are phase II detoxification enzymes that may have evolved in response to changes of environmental substrates. GST genes formed a multigene family and in mammals, there are six classes known as Alpha, Mu, Omega, Pi, Theta, and Zeta. Recent studies in phase I detoxification system specifically the cytochrome P450s provided a general explanation on why genes from a common origin such as those in a multigene family have both phylogenetically stable and unstable genes. Genes that participate in core functions of organisms such as development and physiology are stable whereas genes that play a role in detoxification are unstable and evolve in a process known as birth-death evolution, which is characterised by frequent gene gains and losses. The generality of the birth-death model at explaining the evolution of detoxification enzymes beyond the phase I enzyme has not been comprehensively explored. This work utilized 383 Gst genes and 300 pseudogenes across 22 mammalian species to study gene gains and losses. GSTs vary greatly in their phylogenetic stability despite their overall sequence similarity. Stable Gst genes from Omega and Zeta classes do not show fluctuation in gene numbers from human to opossum. These genes play a role in biosynthesis related functions. Unstable genes that include Alpha, Mu, Pi and Theta undergo frequent gene gain and loss in a process known as birth-death evolution. Gene members of these four classes are well known for their roles in detoxification. Our positive selection screen identified five positively selected sites in mouse GSTA3. Previous studies showed two of these sites (108H and 208E) were biochemically tested as important residues that conferred catalytic activity against the toxic aflatoxin B-1-8,9-epoxide. The functional significance against aflatoxin of the remaining three positively selected sites warrant further investigation.

TI Leprosy at the edge of Europe-Biomolecular, isotopic and
   osteoarchaeological findings from medieval Ireland
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID MYCOBACTERIUM-LEPRAE; RED SQUIRRELS; PHOSPHATE; AGE
AB Relatively little is known of leprosy in Medieval Ireland; as an island located at the far west of Europe it has the potential to provide interesting insights in relation to the historical epidemiology of the disease. To this end the study focuses on five cases of probable leprosy identified in human skeletal remains excavated from inhumation burials. Three of the individuals derived from the cemetery of St Michael Le Pole, Golden Lane, Dublin, while single examples were also identified from Ardreigh, Co. Kildare, and St Patrick's Church, Armoy, Co. Antrim. The individuals were radiocarbon dated and examined biomolecularly for evidence of either of the causative pathogens, M. leprae or M. lepromatosis. Oxygen and strontium isotopes were measured in tooth enamel and rib samples to determine where the individuals had spent their formative years and to ascertain if they had undertaken any recent migrations. We detected M. leprae DNA in the three Golden Lane cases but not in the probable cases from either Ardreigh Co. Kildare or Armoy, Co. Antrim. M. lepromatosis was not detected in any of the burals. DNA preservation was sufficiently robust to allow genotyping of M. leprae strains in two of the Golden Lane burials, SkCXCV (12-13th century) and SkCCXXX (11-13th century). These strains were found to belong on different lineages of the M. leprae phylogenetic tree, namely branches 3 and 2 respectively. Whole genome sequencing was also attempted on these two isolates with a view to gaining further information but poor genome coverage precluded phylogenetic analysis. Data from the biomolecular study was combined with osteological, isotopic and radiocarbon dating to provide a comprehensive and multidisciplinary study of the Irish cases. Strontium and oxygen isotopic analysis indicate that two of the individuals from Golden Lane (SkCXLVIII (10-11th century) and SkCXCV) were of Scandinavian origin, while SkCCXXX may have spent his childhood in the north of Ireland or central Britain. We propose that the Vikings were responsible for introducing leprosy to Ireland. This work adds to our knowledge of the likely origins of leprosy in Medieval Ireland and will hopefully stimulate further research into the history and spread of this ancient disease across the world.

TI Development of the Wheelchair outcomes Assessment Tool for Children
   (WATCh): A patient-centred outcome measure for young wheelchair users
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MOBILITY
AB Objective
   To develop a patient-centred outcome measure (PCOM) for use with children and young people accessing National Health Service (NHS) wheelchair and posture services. Identifying and addressing outcomes of most importance to young wheelchair users (<= 18 years) will help services maximise the benefits achievable within available resources.
   Methods
   A mixed-methods approach was used, involving questionnaire surveys and qualitative interviews, and building on previous work identifying how young wheelchair users define healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL). Framework analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts. Survey questionnaires seeking views on the importance of a range of outcomes were completed by 21 young wheelchair users or their parents. Subsequent face-to-face interviews with 11 parents or dyads of parents and young wheelchair users explored these responses and identified novel outcomes. Interviewees also scored and recorded satisfaction levels for their key outcomes.
   Results
   All outcomes proposed in the survey were rated as 'extremely important' by at least one respondent, as were additional outcomes uncovered in the qualitative data. In consultation with the service providers and service users, the Wheelchair outcomes Assessment Tool for Children (WATCh) was developed to allow service users and providers to identify, score and monitor individual users' most important outcomes. The final WATCh tool comprises 16 outcome options, of which service users select five to be monitored. The tool will be used to measure key outcomes identified by service users before and after wheelchair provision.

TI Injury-induced cold sensitization in Drosophila larvae involves
   behavioral shifts that require the TRP channel Brv1

AB Nociceptive sensitization involves an increase in responsiveness of pain sensing neurons to sensory stimuli, typically through the lowering of their nociceptive threshold. Nociceptive sensitization is common following tissue damage, inflammation, and disease and serves to protect the affected area while it heals. Organisms can become sensitized to a range of noxious and innocuous stimuli, including thermal stimuli. The basic mechanisms underlying sensitization to warm or painfully hot stimuli have begun to be elucidated, however, sensitization to cold is not well understood. Here, we develop a Drosophila assay to study cold sensitization after UV-induced epidermal damage in larvae. Larvae respond to acute cold stimuli with a set of unique behaviors that include a contraction of the head and tail (CT) or a raising of the head and tail into a U-Shape (US). Under baseline, non-injured conditions larvae primarily produce a CT response to an acute cold (10 degrees C) stimulus, however, we show that cold-evoked responses shift following tissue damage: CT responses decrease, US responses increase and some larvae exhibit a lateral body roll (BR) that is typically only observed in response to high temperature and noxious mechanical stimuli. At the cellular level, class III neurons are required for the decrease in CT, chordotonal neurons are required for the increase in US, and chordotonal and class IV neurons are required for the appearance of BR responses after UV. At the molecular level, we found that the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel brivido-1 (brv1) is required for these behavioral shifts. Our Drosophila model will allow us to precisely identify the genes and circuits involved in cold nociceptive sensitization.

TI Stormwater influences phytoplankton assemblages within the diverse, but

AB Sydney Harbour is subjected to persistent stress associated with anthropogenic activity and global climate change, but is particularly subjected to pulse stress events associated with stormwater input during episodic periods of high rainfall. Photosynthetic microbes underpin metazoan diversity within estuarine systems and are therefore important bioindicators of ecosystem health; yet how stormwater input affects their occurrence and distribution in Sydney Harbour remains poorly understood. We utilised molecular tools (16S/18S rRNA and petB genes) to examine how the phytoplankton community structure (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes) within Sydney Harbour varies between high and low rainfall periods. The relative proportion of phytoplankton sequences was more abundant during the high rainfall period, comprising mainly of diatoms, an important functional group supporting increased productivity within estuarine systems, together with cyanobacteria. Increased spatial variability in the phytoplankton community composition was observed, potentially driven by the steepened physico-chemical gradients associated with stormwater inflow. Conversely, during a low rainfall period, the proportion of planktonic photosynthetic microbes was significantly lower and the persistent phytoplankton were predominantly represented by chlorophyte and dinoflagellate sequences, with lower overall diversity. Differences in phytoplankton composition between the high and low rainfall periods were correlated with temperature, salinity, total nitrogen and silicate. These results suggest that increased frequency of high-rainfall events may change the composition, productivity and health of the estuary. Our study begins to populate the knowledge gap in the phytoplankton community structure and substantial changes associated with transient environmental perturbations, an essential step towards unravelling the dynamics of primary production in a highly urbanised estuarine ecosystem in response to climate change and other anthropogenic stressors.

AB Immigration from collectivist cultures to Western countries often results in loss of social capital and changing family dynamics leading to isolation and acculturative stress. This study explored the impact of social and cultural changes experienced by seven migrant communities residing in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. It deconstructed the role of local community and networks in their initial settlement in absence of traditional forms of community support. Data were collected through fourteen focus group discussions (164 participants). Five major themes emerged: (i) changing gender roles and women empowerment; (ii) sending money home; (iii) culture shock and increased intercultural conflict; (iv) change in lifestyle from collective to individual culture; and (v) role of extended community in mitigating culture shock. These findings suggest that community interventions aimed at improving cultural and social engagement of migrants employ social capital framework. This will ensure enhanced communication within migrant families and communities from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

AB Background
   It is a daunting task to discontinue pertussis completely in China owing to its growing increase in the incidence. While basic to any formulation of prevention and control measures is early response for future epidemic trends. Discrete wavelet transform(DWT) has been emerged as a powerful tool in decomposing time series into different constituents, which facilitates better improvement in prediction accuracy. Thus we aim to integrate modeling approaches as a decision-making supportive tool for formulating health resources.
   Methods
   We constructed a novel hybrid method based on the pertussis morbidity cases from January 2004 to May 2018 in China, where the approximations and details decomposed by DWT were forecasted by a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive network (NAR), respectively. Then, the obtained values were aggregated as the final results predicted by the combined model. Finally, the performance was compared with the SARIMA, NAR and traditional SARIMA-NAR techniques.
   Results
   The hybrid technique at level 2 of db2 wavelet including a SARIMA(0,1,3)(1,0,0)(12)modelfor the approximation-forecasting and NAR model with 12 hidden units and 4 delays for the detail d1-forecasting, along with another NAR model with 11 hidden units and 5 delays for the detail d2-forecasting notably outperformed other wavelets, SARIMA, NAR and traditional SARIMA-NAR techniques in terms of the mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. Descriptive statistics exhibited that a substantial rise was observed in the notifications from 2013 to 2018, and there was an apparent seasonality with summer peak. Moreover, the trend was projected to continue upwards in the near future.
   Conclusions
   This hybrid approach has an outstanding ability to improve the prediction accuracy relative to the others, which can be of great help in the prevention of pertussis. Besides, under current trend of pertussis morbidity, it is required to urgently address strategically within the proper policy adopted.

TI Failure to demonstrate short-cutting in a replication and extension of
   Tolman et al.'s spatial learning experiment with humans
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LOCATION; KNOWLEDGE; BLOCKING; GEOMETRY
AB Successful demonstrations of novel short-cut taking by animals, including humans, are open to interpretation in terms of learning that is not necessarily spatial. A classic example is that of Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish (1946) who allowed rats to repeat a sequence of turns through the corridors of a maze to locate a food reward. When the entrance to the corridors was subsequently blocked and alternative corridors were made available, rats successfully selected the corridor leading most directly to the food location. However, the presence of a distinctive light above the goal, in both the training and testing phases, means that approach to the light as a beacon could have been the source of successful short-cutting. We report a replication of the experimental design of Tolman et al. with human participants who explored geometrically equivalent virtual environments. An experimental group, who followed the original procedure in the absence of any distinctive cues proximal to the goal, did not select the corridor which led most directly to the goal. A control group, who experienced a light above the goal during training and testing, were more likely to select a corridor which led in the direction of the goal. A second control group experienced the light above the goal during training, but in the test the location of this cue was shifted by 90 degrees with respect to the start point of exploration. This latter group responded unsystematically in the test, neither selecting a corridor leading to the original goal location, nor one leading directly to the relocated light cue. The results do not support the hypothesis that travelling a multi-path route automatically leads to an integrated cognitive representation of that route. The data offer support for the importance of local cues which can serve as beacons to indicate the location of a goal.

TI Tumor-secreted factors induce IL-1 beta maturation via the

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   PROGRESSION; GROWTH; POLARIZATION
AB Macrophages are one of the major cell types that produce IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta maturation occurs via inflammasome activation, and mature IL-1 beta is then released from the cell. Secreted IL-1 beta mediates inflammatory reactions in various pathological environments, such as those in infectious, autoimmune, and cancerous diseases. Although the mechanism of IL-1 beta production has been discovered in infectious and autoimmune diseases, its production mechanism in the tumor microenvironment is unclear. Therefore, the mechanism of IL-1 beta production in macrophages in the tumor microenvironment was investigated in this study. First, bone marrow- derived macrophages obtained from C57BL/6 mice were treated with B16F10 tumorconditioned media (TCM) in vitro. TCM increased the levels of IL-1 beta via glucose-mediated activation of the inflammasome. Moreover, TCM enhanced the activation of both NF-kappa B and mTOR pathways in a glucose-dependent manner. In particular, the expression levels of mTORC1 component proteins were dependent on the TCM-induced activation of NF-kappa B signaling. In addition, TCM affected ASC-ASC interactions through increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. Finally, glucose inhibition by inoculation with 2-deoxy-D-glucose in vivo decreased the IL-1 beta levels in both the blood and tumor region of B16F10-bearing C57BL/6 mice relative to those in PBS-injected tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that glucose supplied from blood vessels might be important for IL-1 beta production in tumor-associated macrophages via the integrated signals of the NF-kappa B and mTOR pathways in the tumor microenvironment.

AB Purpose
   This study aimed to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy of respiratory gated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) under simulation conditions similar to the actual clinical situation using patient-specific lung phantoms and realistic target movements.
   Methods
   Six heterogeneous lung phantoms were fabricated using a 3D-printer (3DISON, ROKIT, Seoul, Korea) to be dosimetrically equivalent to actual target regions of lung SBRT cases treated via gated VMAT. They were designed to move realistically via a motion device (QUASAR, Modus Medical Devices, Canada). Using the lung phantoms and a homogeneous phantom (model 500-3315, Modus Medical Devices), film dosimetry was performed with and without respiratory gating for VMAT delivery (TrueBeam STx; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The measured results were analyzed with the gamma passing rates (GPRs) of 2%/1 mm criteria, by comparing with the calculated dose via the AXB and AAA algorithms of the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (version 10.0.28; Varian Medical Systems).
   Results
   GPRs were greater than the acceptance criteria 80% for all film measurements with the stationary and homogeneous phantoms in conventional QAs. Regardless of the heterogeneity of phantoms, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in GPRs obtained with and without target motions; the statistical significance (p = 0.031) was presented between both algorithms under the utilization of heterogeneous phantoms.
   Conclusions
   Dosimetric verification with heterogeneous patient-specific lung phantoms could be successfully implemented as the evaluation method for gated VMAT delivery. In addition, it could be dosimetrically confirmed that the AXB algorithm improved the dose calculation accuracy under patient-specific simulations using 3D printed lung phantoms.

AB During pond culture of Eriocheir sinensis, a high limb-impairment rate restricts the industry development and quality. Therefore, research on limb autotomy and regeneration has important practical significance for the industrial development and basic biology of E. sinensis. This study evaluated the changes in bud morphology, growth-related gene expression and nutritional status during cheliped regeneration in E. sinensis. The study found that the new cheliped was pre-formed in the bud and then regenerated with the completion of molting of E. sinensis. The new cheliped was similar in morphology to the normal cheliped after the first molting but smaller in size. The qRT-PCR results of growth-related genes showed that the expression levels of EcR-mRNA (ecdysteroid receptor) and Chi-mRNA (chitinase) were significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of MIH-mRNA (molt-inhibiting hormone) was significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05). The nutritional status during the regeneration process showed that the hepatopancreas total lipid content decreased significantly within 28 days and was significantly lower in the autotomy group than in the control group at 14 d and 21 d (P < 0.05). The hepatopancreas fatty acid composition results showed that saturated fatty acids (SFA), highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) and n-3/n-6 were significantly higher in the autotomy group than in the control group at 21 d (P < 0.05), whereas the Sigma n-6 PUFA and Sigma n-3 PUFA at 1 d and 7 d, and the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) at 28 d in the autotomy group were significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of eicosatetraenoic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) showed that DHA was significantly lower at 7 d and significantly higher at 21 d in the autotomy group than in the control group (P < 0.05), whereas ARA and EPA were not significantly different between the two groups. Muscle L-tryptophan content was significantly lower at 1 d and significantly higher at 7 d in the autotomy group than in the control group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that during the cheliped regeneration process, crabs could accelerate molting and regeneration by regulating growth-related gene expression (e.g., EcR-mRNA and MIH-mRNA) and nutrient metabolism (e.g., lipid metabolism).

TI A survey of argasid ticks and tick-associated pathogens in the

AB Argasid ticks (Acari: Argasidae) carry and transmit a variety of pathogens of animals and humans, including viruses, bacteria and parasites. There are several studies reporting ixodid ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) and associated tick-borne pathogens in Xinjiang, China. However, little is known about the argasid ticks and argasid tick-associated pathogens in this area. In this study, a total of 3829 adult argasid ticks infesting livestock were collected at 12 sampling sites of 10 counties in the Peripheral Oases, which carry 90% of the livestock and humans population, around the Tarim Basin (southern Xinjiang) from 2013 to 2016. Tick specimens were identified to two species from different genera by morphology and sequences of mitochondrial 16S rRNA and 12S rRNA were derived to confirm the species designation. The results showed that the dominant argasid ticks infesting livestock in southern Xinjiang were Ornithodoros lahorensis (87.86%, 3364/3829). Ornithodoros lahorensis was distributed widely and were collected from 10 counties of southern Xinjiang. Argas japonicus was collected from Xinjiang for the first time. In addition, we screened these ticks for tick-associated pathogens and showed the presence of DNA sequences of Rickettsia spp. of Spotted fever group and Anaplasma spp. in the argasid ticks. This finding suggests the potential role for Argas japonicus as a vector of pathogens to livestock and humans.

TI Reliability of information about the use of antiepileptic drugs during
   pregnancy from three major web search engines in China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EPILEPSY; INTERNET; WOMEN; RISKS
AB Objectives
   The objective of this study was to assess the reliability of online information, as provided by three major search engines in China, about the usage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy.
   Method
   Over eight weeks, six physicians conducted a literature search on six computers and six smartphones at a frequency of once per week. During each web search on each computer and smartphone, three major search engines in China were used, namely, Baidu, Sogou and 360. The search terms used were a combination of words, including one AED name (valproate/oxcarbazepine/levetiracetam/lamotrigine) and one Chinese word ("huaiyun" or "renshen", which means pregnancy in Chinese). The top ten websites retrieved from each search were recorded. After the content of each website was evaluated, the sites were categorized into 9 types. Meanwhile, commercial advertisements on each web page were also registered.
   Results
   A total of 16,411 search results were assessed. After excluding the redundant web pages, 4840 search results were included in the data analysis. Only 12.05% of the search results were reliable, 47.75% were partly reliable, and 40.21% were unreliable. A total of 4139 (85.52%) webpages contained commercial advertisements. The results from a multivariate analysis suggested that websites with no advertisements and professional websites have an independent positive impact on reliability.
   Conclusion
   Overall, little information on AED usage during pregnancy provided by major search engines in China was reliable.

   BACTERIA; MITOSIS
AB Cell populations across nearly all forms of life generally maintain a characteristic cell type-dependent size, but how size control is achieved has been a long-standing question. The G1/S boundary of the cell cycle serves as a major point of size control, and mechanisms operating here restrict passage of cells to Start if they are too small. In contrast, it is less clear how size is regulated post-Start, during S/G2/M. To gain further insight into post-Start size control, we prepared budding yeast that can be reversibly blocked from bud initiation. While blocked, cells continue to grow isotropically, increasing their volume by more than an order of magnitude over unperturbed cells. Upon release from their block, giant mothers reenter the cell cycle and their progeny rapidly return to the original unperturbed size. We found this behavior to be consistent with a size-invariant 'timer' specifying the duration of S/G2/M. These results indicate that yeast use at least two distinct mechanisms at different cell cycle phases to ensure size homeostasis.

AB Introduction
   Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and gastroparesis are two types of diabetic autonomic neuropathy which could affect patients' quality of life and carry significant morbidity and mortality outcomes. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of both CAN and gastroparesis symptoms among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at primary health care level.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 adults with T2DM from April 1, 2017 to March 20, 2018. CAN was defined by the presence of any of the followings: resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension or prolonged corrected QT interval in the electrocardiogram. Gastroparesis symptoms were assessed using a validated questionnaire: the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index.
   Results
   The mean age of study participants and disease duration were 55.26 +/- 10.65 years and 10.77 +/- 6.89 years, respectively. CAN was present in 15.3% of the participants. Hypertension, smoking, antihypertensive use, body mass index, dyslipidemia and albuminuria were significantly higher in participants with CAN than those without CAN (p<0.05). Prolonged disease duration (p = 0.007) and hypertension (p = 0.004) were independently associated with CAN. Gastroparesis symptoms were present in 6.3% of study participants and were significantly associated with those of female gender (P<0.05). Metformin use emerged as an independent predictor of the presence of at least one symptom (p = 0.001).
   Conclusion
   Among Saudi adults with T2DM at primary care level, the prevalence of CAN is significant and is independently related to disease duration and hypertension, indicating the importance of CAN screening, especially for those with prolonged disease duration, and the importance of controlling blood pressure in order to prevent CAN or its consequences. The prevalence of gastroparesis symptoms is 6% and is independently related to metformin use, and therefore, symptomatic screening is required to decide which patients need further evaluation.

AB The Amazon basin harbors a megadiverse fish fauna spread in an intricate network of big rivers and small streams. The Amazonian streams are home of many small sized fishes that remains poorly documented. In order to accelerate the scientific knowledge on these important aquatic systems we adopted a modern integrative approach joining morphology and molecular tools to investigate the ichthyofauna assemblages from low order streams situated on the lower Tapajos River Basin. Cytochrome c Oxidase I (COI) DNA barcodes from 252 specimens collected from 10 stream sites were obtained. The combined analysis revealed 29 species, 21 genera and 11 families. Cryptic diversity was evidenced in Knodus sp. 1, Aequidens epae and Copella callolepis, in which deep genetic divergence were detected (intraspecific distances: 20.48%, 7.99% and 3.77%, respectively). The putative new species showed closer relationships with their counterparts occurring in the Tapajos-Xingu water drainages.

AB Global dissemination of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing bacteria has become a major health threat. However, there are few reports regarding the identification and characterisation of NDM-producing bacteria from West Africa, including Ghana. An Escherichia coli strain with resistance to meropenem was isolated from the Tamale Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Its identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility profile were carried out using commercial systems. The antibiotic resistance mechanism was analysed by phenotypic detection kits, PCR, and DNA sequencing. Conjugation experiments, S1 nuclease pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting were performed. Finally, the NDM-1-harbouring plasmid was characterised using next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The meropenem-resistant Escherichia coli strain EC2189 harboured bla(NDM-1) and belonged to sequence type 410. bla(NDM-1) was located on the IncHI type transferrable plasmid p2189-NDM (248,807 bp long), which co-carried multiple resistance genes, such as bla(CTX-M-15), aadA1, aac(6')-Ib, sul3, dfrA12, and cmlA1. p2189-NDM phylogenetically differed from previously identified bla(NDM-1)-positive IncHI type plasmids. A truncated Tn125 containing bla(NDM-1) was bracketed by an ISSm-1-like insertion sequence upstream and by a site-specific integrase downstream. To the best of our knowledge, we have, for the first time identified and molecularly characterised an NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae strain in Ghana with bla(NDM-1) that had a novel genetic structure. Our findings indicate a possibility of NDM-1 dissemination in Ghana and underscore the need for constant monitoring of carbapenemase-producing bacteria.

SO PLOS ONE

ID OPTIMUM INSULATION-THICKNESS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; IN-SITU
   MEASUREMENT; EXTERNAL WALLS
AB This article aims to model the thermal behaviour of a wall using deep learning techniques. The Fourier theoretical model which is traditionally used to model such enclosures is not capable of considering several factors that affect a prediction that is often incorrect. These results motivate us to try to obtain a better thermal model of the enclosure. For this reason, a connexionist model is provided capable of modelling the behaviour of the enclosure from actual observed temperature data. For the training of this model, several measurements have been obtained over the course of more than one year in a specific enclosure, distributing the readings among the different layers of it. In this work, the predictions of both the theoretical model and the connexionist model have been tested, contrasting them with the measurements obtained previously. It has been observed that the connexionist model substantially improves the theoretical predictions of the Fourier method, thus allowing better approximations to be made regarding the real energy consumption of the building and, in general, the prediction of the energy behaviour of the enclosure.

TI Haplotypes in the CYP2R1 gene are associated with levels of 25(OH)D and

   FRACTURE; STANDARDIZATION; MORTALITY; ENZYME
AB Objective
   Polymorphisms in the CYP2R1 gene encoding Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase have been reported to correlate with circulating levels of 25-OH vitamin D3 (25(OH)D). It is unknown whether these variations also affect overall bone metabolism. In order to elucidate the overall associations of polymorphisms in the CYP2R1, we studied haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene and serum levels of 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), as well as bone mineral density (BMD).
   Methods
   Baseline data on serum parameters and BMD from MrOS Sweden, a prospective population-based cohort study of elderly men (mean age 75 years, range 69-81), were analyzed. Genotyping was performed for eight SNPs covering the CYP2R1 gene in 2868 men with available samples of DNA. Subjects were followed up concerning incidence of fracture during five years.
   Results
   There was a significant genetic association with circulating levels of 25(OH)D (4.6-18.5% difference in mean values between SNP alleles), but there were no correlations with levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH or FGF23 for any genetic variant. No differences were found in fracture incidence between the variants. There was an inverse relationship between lower BMD and concomitant higher 25(OH)D for three of the haplotypes (p < 0.005).
   Conclusions
   Common variants in the CYP2R1 gene encoding Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase correlate with levels of circulating 25(OH)D but do not otherwise associate with measures of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Presence of the specific haplotypes may be an indicator of risk for low 25(OH)D levels, and may in addition be correlated to bone mineral density.

AB Soil respiration plays a crucial role in global carbon cycling. While the response of soil respiration to abiotic drivers like soil temperature and moisture is fairly well understood, less is known about the effects of biotic drivers, such as plant above- and belowground productivity or plant diversity, and their interactions with abiotic drivers on soil respiration. Thus, current predictions of soil respiration to summer droughts might miss relevant biological drivers and their interactions with abiotic drivers. Since drought events are expected to increase in Central Europe in the future, we simulated early summer drought using rainout shelters at 19 grassland sites, which differed in plant productivity and species richness in central Germany in 2002 and 2003. We tested the potentially interacting effects of drought with biotic drivers, i.e. annual above-ground productivity, species richness and root biomass, on the drought response of soil respiration in temperate grasslands. In both years, drought led to a significant reduction in soil respiration. The drought-induced reduction in soil respiration was largely driven by the reduction in above-ground productivity in response to drought. The extent of the drought response of soil respiration was dependent on the species richness level of the site and this interacting effect was explainable by the variation in root biomass (root biomass and species richness were positively correlated). Our findings highlight the importance of biotic drivers for the quantification of the drought response of soil respiration in grasslands.

TI Lipids alter microbial transport through intestinal mucus

   OIL
AB Mucus constitutes a protective layer which coats the gastrointestinal tract, controlling interactions of both commensal and pathogenic microbes with underlying tissues. Changes to the mucus barrier, for example due to altered mucin expression or external stimuli, may impact interactions with microbes and thus potentially contribute to altered gut homeostasis, onset of inflammation, or pathogen invasion. Food-associated stimuli, including lipids, have been shown to change mucus barrier properties and reduce transport of model drug carriers through mucus. Here, we explore the impact of lipids, specifically triglycerides in a model intestinal medium mimicking a fed state, on Escherichia coli (E. coli) transport through mucus by directly imaging swimming patterns and analyzing associated changes in mucus structure. Lipids in model fed state intestinal contents reduced E. coli speed and track linearity within mucus. These changes may be due in part to changes in molecular interactions within the mucus network as well as crowding of the mucus network by lipid emulsion droplets, which visibly stay intact in the mucus gel. In addition, observed physical interactions between bacteria and lipid structures may impact microbial speed and trajectories. As lipids are normal food components and thus represent safe, mild stimuli, these results support exploration of lipid-based strategies to alter the mucus barrier to control interactions with microbes and potentially prevent microbial invasion of underlying epithelium.

   OUTCOMES; RISK; CYCLOSPORINE; METAANALYSIS; NEPHROPATHY; PROTEINURIA
AB Despite tacrolimus (TAC) drug-level monitoring, TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis remains an important problem. This study investigated the potential of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) as a chronic renal allograft fibrosis biomarker in a two-phase study (proof of concept and cohort). In the proof of concept stage of the study, increased TAC-doses at 3 days after dose adjustment compared with the baseline were associated with elevated uNGAL (+Delta uNGAL) and urinary interleukin 18 (IL-18), but normal serum creatinine (SCr), despite the therapeutic trough levels of TAC. In the cohort study, the patients with elevated uNGAL post-recruitment in comparison with the baseline (+Delta uNGAL) was associated with the more severe renal allograft fibrosis from renal pathology of the protocol biopsy at 12 months post kidney transplantation (post-KT). A cut-off value of uNGAL >= 125.2 ng/mL during a 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-KT was associated with a higher fibrosis score, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.88, p < 0.0001) and a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.54 (95% CI 1.45 to 9.33; p < 0.001). We conclude that uNGAL is a sensitive biomarker of TAC induced subtle renal injury and TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis. We propose that uNGAL measurements, in addition to trough levels of TAC, should be used to predict TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis in the recipients of KT.

AB Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system leads to systemic hypertension and maladaptive fibrosis in various organs. We showed recently that myocardial fibrosis and the loss of cardiac function in mice with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) could be averted by treatment with the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) peptide. Here, we used angiotensin II (AngII) infusion (2.1 mg/kg/day for 2 wk) in mice as a second model to confirm and extend our observations on the beneficial effects of CSD on heart and kidney disease. AngII caused cardiac hypertrophy (increased heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area); fibrosis in heart and kidney (increased levels of collagen I and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47)); and vascular leakage (increased levels of IgG in heart and kidney). Echocardiograms of AngII-infused mice showed increased left ventricular posterior wall thickness (pWTh) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and decreased ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO). CSD treatment (i. p. injections, 50 mu g/mouse/day) of AngII-infused mice significantly suppressed all of these pathological changes in fibrosis, hypertrophy, vascular leakage, and ventricular function. AngII infusion increased beta 1 and beta 3 integrin levels and activated Pyk2 in both heart and kidney. These changes were also suppressed by CSD. Finally, bone marrow cell (BMC) isolated from AngII-infused mice showed hyper-migration toward SDF1. When AngII-infused mice were treated with CSD, BMC migration was reduced to the basal level observed in cells from control mice. Importantly, CSD did not affect the AngII-induced increase in blood pressure (BP), indicating that the beneficial effects of CSD were not mediated via normalization of BP. These results strongly indicate that CSD suppresses AngII-induced pathological changes in mice, suggesting that CSD can be developed as a treatment for patients with hypertension and pressure overloadinduced heart failure.

AB Background
   The prevalence of heart failure (HF) and its economic burden are increasing with age of the South Korean population. This study aimed to assess the economic impact of HF from the societal perspective.
   Methods
   A prevalence-based, incremental cost-of-patient study was performed to estimate the cost ratio between patients with HF and those without HF based on the claims database of the national health insurance in South Korea. We defined adult HF patients as those aged. 19 years who had at least one insurance claim record with a primary or secondary diagnosis of HF. Age-and gender-matched controls were defined using a 1: 4 greedy matching method. Costs were estimated by including medical costs for insurance-covered and non-covered services, transportation costs, caregiver's cost, and time costs of patients. The ratio of costs between patients with HF and those without HF was adjusted for age, gender, and type of universal health security program in the multivariate regression model.
   Results
   The average annual per-capita cost was estimated to be $6,601 for patients with HF (n = 14,252), which is about 3.38 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.31-3.46) times higher than that for patients without HF (n = 1,116,882) and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.59-1.70) times higher than that for the age-and gender-matched patients without HF (n = 57,008). In the multivariate regression model, the annual per-capita total costs were 1.98-fold (95% CI: 1.94-2.02) statistically higher for patients with HF than for patients without HF after adjustment for age, gender, and type of universal health security program.
   Conclusions
   This study demonstrates a significant incremental burden of HF. Given that the prevalence of HF is expected to increase with an increase in the aging population, the nationaleconomic burden is expected to be substantial in the future. Thus, greater emphasis on the prevention and treatment of HF is warranted.

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH) exerts dual effects, anabolic or catabolic, on bone when administrated intermittently or continuously, via mechanisms that remain largely unknown. PTH binding to cells induces PTH-responsive genes including primary response genes (PRGs). PRGs are rapidly induced without the need for de novo protein synthesis, thereby playing pivotal roles in directing subsequent molecular responses. In this study, to understand the role of PRGs in mediating osteoblastic cellular responses to PTH, we investigated whether various durations of PTH differentially induce PRGs in primary osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1. Nurr1 and RANKL, PRGs known for their anabolic and catabolic roles in bone metabolism respectively, presented distinctive transient vs. sustained induction kinetics. Corroborating their roles, maximum induction of Nurr1 was sufficiently achieved by brief PTH in as little as 30 minutes and continued beyond that, while maximum induction of RANKL was achieved only by prolonged PTH over 4 hours. Our data suggested distinctive regulatory mechanisms for Nurr1 and RANKL: PKA-mediated chromatin rearrangement for transcriptional regulation of both PRGs and ERK-mediated transcriptional regulation for RANKL but not Nurr1. Lastly, we classified PRGs into two groups based on the induction kinetics: The group that required brief PTH for maximum induction included Nur77, cox-2, and Nurr1, all of which are reported to play roles in bone formation. The other group that required prolonged PTH for maximum induction included IL-6 and RANKL, which play roles in bone resorption. Together, our data suggested the crucial role of PRG groups in mediating differential osteoblastic cellular responses to intermittent vs. continuous PTH. Continued research into the regulatory mechanisms of PKA and ERK for PRGs will help us better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the dual effects of PTH, thereby optimizing the current therapeutic use of PTH for osteoporosis.

AB Soil is one of the most complex systems on Earth, functioning at the interface between the lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere and generating a multitude of functions. Moreover, soil constitutes the belowground environment from which plants capture water and nutrients. Despite their great importance, soil properties are often not sufficiently considered in other disciplines, especially in spatial studies of plant distributions. Most soil properties are available as point data and, to be used in spatial analyses, need to be generalised over entire regions (i.e. digital soil mapping). Three categories of statistical approaches can be used for such purpose: geostatistical approaches (GSA), predictive-statistical approaches (PSA), and hybrid approaches (HA) that combine the two previous ones. How then to choose the best approach in a given soil study context? Does it depend on the soil properties to be spatialized, the study area's characteristics, and/or the availability of soil data? The main aims of this study was to review the use of these three approaches to derive maps of soil properties in relation to the soil parameters, the study area characteristics, and the number of soil samples. We evidenced that the approaches that tend to show the best performance for spatializing soil properties were not necessarily the ones most used in practice. Although PSA was the most widely used, it tended to be outperformed by HA in many cases, but the latter was far less used. However, as the study settings were not always properly described and not all situations were represented in the set of papers analysed, more comparative studies would be needed across a wider range of regions, soil properties, and spatial scales to provide robust conclusions on the best spatialization methods in a specific context.

ID AIC MODEL SELECTION; DECLINING OXYGEN; MULTIMODEL INFERENCE; BODY-SIZE;
   TENSION; ADAPTATIONS; REGRESSION; ECOLOGY
AB A new method is presented for describing the rate of oxygen consumption in response to progressive hypoxia. The method consists of screening candidate functions describing the relationship between Vo(2) (oxygen consumption rate) and Po-2 (ambient oxygen concentration) by testing each for fit to observed data for a single curve and the function that best fits is chosen using lowest AICc value as the criterion. Descriptive statistics are then extracted from the selected function that best describes the pattern present in the curve. Several new descriptive statistics for the pattern of response are proposed which are based on the null model of simple diffusion and no regulation. The method quantifies deviation from the null model at each point on the curve and measures both positive and negative deviation which occur when the curve changes more slowly or more rapidly than the null model predicts, respectively. The new descriptive statistics generalize the traditional one used in the past, the critical oxygen tension (P-c), and allow interpretation of a variety of shapes of curves which cannot be analyzed with conventional methods. Because the method is descriptive, it does not implicate any specific mechanisms in generating the response. The method is applied to data from 68 animals in 14 different species groups reported in the literature. The overall results suggest the existence of substantial diversity in response types among animals, which requires a more complex description than has traditionally been used.

AB Species loss from upper trophic levels can result in some major changes in community structure and ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally excluded macroconsumers (e.g., fish and shrimp) in a Brazilian karst tropical stream during the dry season to investigate if their loss affected the accrual of calcium, dry mass (DM) and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of sediment, benthic invertebrates, and chlorophyll-a. We found that the exclusion of macroconsumers decreased accrual of calcium. The absence of fish and shrimp may have promoted increased grazing by mayflies and snails in the electrified treatment as expressed by the depressed calcium accrual and shift in periphyton community composition. However, the exclusion of macroconsumers had no effect on DM and AFDM, chlorophyll-a, or total abundance of invertebrates. Our findings shed new light on the impact of macroconsumer loss and consequences for calcium accrual in karstic streams.

AB Ginkgo biloba (EGb761) is a widely used botanical drug. Several reports indicate that EGb761 confers preventive as well as anti-tumorigenic properties in a variety of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We here evaluate functional effects and molecular alterations induced by EGb761 in hepatoma cells and non-malignant hepatocytes. Hepatoma cell lines, primary human HCC cells and immortalized human hepatocytes (IH) were exposed to various concentrations (0-1000 mu g/ml) of EGb761. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated after 72h of EGb761 exposure. Response to oxidative stress, tumorigenic properties and molecular changes were further investigated. While anti-oxidant effects were detected in all cell lines, EGb761 promoted anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects mainly in hepatoma cells. Consistently, EGb761 treatment caused a significant reduction in colony and sphere forming ability in hepatoma cells and no mentionable changes in IH. Transcriptomic changes involved oxidative stress response as well as key oncogenic pathways resembling Nrf2- and mTOR signaling pathway. Taken together, EGb761 induces differential effects in non-transformed and cancer cells. While treatment confers protective effects in non-malignant cells, EGb761 significantly impairs tumorigenic properties in cancer cells by affecting key oncogenic pathways. Results provide the rational for clinical testing of EGb761 in preventive and therapeutic strategies in human liver diseases.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

AB Classically, in the bouba-kiki association task, a subject is asked to find the best association between one of two shapes-a round one and a spiky one-and one of two pseudowords-bouba and kiki. Numerous studies report that spiky shapes are associated with kiki, and round shapes with bouba. This task is likely the most prevalent in the study of non-conventional relationships between linguistic forms and meanings, also known as sound symbolism. However, associative tasks are explicit in the sense that they highlight phonetic and visual contrasts and require subjects to establish a crossmodal link between stimuli of different natures. Additionally, recent studies have raised the question whether visual resemblances between the target shapes and the letters explain the pattern of association, at least in literate subjects. In this paper, we report a more implicit testing paradigm of the bouba-kiki effect with the use of a lexical decision task with character strings presented in round or spiky frames. Pseudowords and words are, furthermore, displayed with either an angular or a curvy font to investigate possible graphemic bias. Innovative analyses of response times are performed with GAMLSS models, which offer a large range of possible distributions of error terms, and a generalized Gama distribution is found to be the most appropriate. No sound symbolic effect appears to be significant, but an interaction effect is in particular observed between spiky shapes and angular letters leading to faster response times. We discuss these results with respect to the visual saliency of angular shapes, priming, brain activation, synaesthesia and ideasthesia.

TI 'A world of competing sorrows': A mixed methods analysis of media
   reports of children with cancer abandoning conventional treatment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PARENTS
AB Background
   We aimed to provide health practitioners greater insight into the public perception of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use. Our objectives were to identify news media reports of children abandoning conventional treatment for traditional and complementary medicine, analyze the thematic content of these news articles and estimate the tonality portrayed.
   Methods
   LexisNexis and Factiva were searched for terms related to cancer, children and T&CM. Inclusion criteria were children less than 18 years, in curative phase of treatment who attempted to abandon conventional therapy for any traditional and complementary medicine use. A secondary search was performed in LexisNexis, Factiva and Google News Archive with the names of children in identified cases. Qualitative analysis of news media reports was completed using a grounded theory approach. Quantitative analysis of article sentiment was performed using a linear support vector machine.
   Results
   Seventeen cases occurring between 2002 and 2016 were included. Five main themes were identified: treatment as torture, power imbalances, rights of parents, evidence versus beliefs and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Sentiment analysis revealed an overall negative tone, as demonstrated by 73% of the articles.
   Interpretation
   A better understanding of factors that lead to abandonment of conventional therapy for traditional and complementary medicine as portrayed in the news media may help healthcare providers prevent the occurrence of these cases.

TI Local care and treatment of liver disease (LOCATE) - A
   cluster-randomized feasibility study to discover, assess and manage
   early liver disease in primary care

AB Background
   Chronic liver disease is an escalating problem both in the United Kingdom and worldwide. In the UK mortality rates have risen sharply over the previous 50 years predominantly due to alcohol, however the increasing prevalence of non-alcohol related fatty liver disease both in the UK and elsewhere is also of concern. Liver disease develops silently hence early detection of fibrosis is essential to prevent progression. Primary care presents an opportunity to identify at risk populations, however assessment largely comprises of indirect markers of fibrosis which have little prognostic value. We hypothesised that setting up nurse-led primary care based liver clinics using additional non-invasive testing would increase the number of new diagnoses of liver disease compared to usual care.
   Methods
   This was a prospective, cluster randomised feasibility trial based in urban primary care in Southampton, United Kingdom. 10 GP practices were randomised to either intervention (liver health nurse) or control (care as usual). Pre recruitment audits were carried out in each practice to ascertain baseline prevalence of liver disease. Participants were subsequently recruited in intervention practices from July 2014-March 2016 via one of 3 pathways: GP referral, nurse led case finding based on risk factors or random AUDIT questionnaire mailouts. Liver assessment included the Southampton Traffic Light test (serum fibrosis markers HA and P3NP) and transient elastography (FibroScan). Cases were ascribed as 'no fibrosis', 'liver warning', 'progressive fibrosis' or 'probable cirrhosis'. Post recruitment audits were repeated and incident liver diagnoses captured from July 2014-September 2016. Each new diagnosis was reviewed in a virtual clinic by a consultant hepatologist.
   Findings
   910 participants were seen in the nurse led clinic-44 (4.8%) probable cirrhosis, 141 (15.5%) progressive fibrosis, 220 (24.2%) liver warning and 505 (55.5%) no evidence of liver fibrosis. 450 (49.5%) cases were due to NAFLD with 356 (39.1%) from alcohol. In the 405 with a liver disease diagnosis, 136 (33.6%) were referred by GP, 218 (53.8%) from nurse led case finding and 51 (12.6%) from the AUDIT mailout. 544 incident cases were identified in the intervention arm compared to 221 in the control arm in the period July 2014-September 2016 (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 2.8).
   Conclusions
   The incorporation of a liver health nurse into GP practices was simple to arrange and yielded a much higher number of new diagnoses of liver disease compared to usual care. Nearly half of all participants recruited had a degree of liver disease. Nurse led case finding and GP referrals were most effective compared to AUDIT questionnaire mailouts in an urban population in identifying unknown disease. Utilising study and previous data allowed quick and effective virtual review by a hepatologist. Identifying those who are at risk of liver disease from harmful alcohol use remains a challenge and needs to be addressed in future work.

TI Unique spectra of deafness-associated mutations in Mongolians provide

AB Genetic factors are an important cause of idiopathic sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI). From the epidemiological perspective, mutations of three deafness genes: GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1, are much more prevalent than those of other genes worldwide. However, mutation spectra of common deafness genes differ remarkably across different populations. Here, we performed comprehensive genetic examination and haplotype analyses in 188 unrelated Mongolian families with idiopathic SNHI, and compared their mutation spectra and haplotypes to those of other European and Asian cohorts. We confirmed genetic diagnoses in 18 (9.6%) of the 188 families, including 13 with bi-allelic GJB2 mutations, three with bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations, and two with homoplasmic MT-RNR1 m. 1555A>G mutation. Moreover, mono-allelic mutations were identified in 17 families (9.0%), including 14 with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations and three with mono-allelic SLC26A4 mutations. Interestingly, three GJB2 mutations prevalent in other populations, including c.35delG in Caucasians, c.235delC in East Asians, and c.-23+1G>A in Southwest and South Asians, were simultaneously detected in Mongolian patients. Haplotype analyses further confirmed founder effects for each of the three mutations, indicating that each mutation derived from its ancestral origin independently. By demonstrating the unique spectra of deafness-associated mutations, our findings may have important clinical and scientific implications for refining the molecular diagnostics of SNHI in Mongolian patients, and for elucidating the genetic relationships among Eurasian populations.

AB Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) is a well-established genetics-based system that uses yeast to selectively display binary protein-protein interactions (PPIs). To meet the current need to unravel complex PPI networks, several adaptations have been made to establish mediumto high-throughput Y2H screening platforms, with several having successfully incorporated the use of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to increase the scale and sensitivity of the method. However, these have been to date mainly restricted to the use of fully annotated custom-made open reading frame (ORF) libraries and subject to complex downstream data processing. Here, a streamlined Y2H library screening strategy, based on integration of Y2H with NGS, called Y2H-seq, was developed, which allows efficient and reliable screening of Y2H cDNA libraries. To generate proof of concept, the method was applied to screen for interaction partners of two key components of the jasmonate signaling machinery in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, resulting in the identification of several previously reported as well as hitherto unknown interactors. Our Y2H-seq method offers a user-friendly, specific and sensitive screening method that allows identification of PPIs without prior knowledge of the organism's ORFs, thereby extending the method to organisms of which the genome has not entirely been annotated yet. The quantitative NGS readout allows to increase genome coverage, thereby overcoming some of the bottlenecks of current Y2H technologies, which will further strengthen the value of the Y2H technology as a discovery platform.

AB Reef configuration and hydrodynamics were identified as the principle physical drivers behind coral reef fish aggregations on a mid-shelf patch reef in the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef (-16.845 degrees, 146.23 degrees). The study was carried out over a six-year period at a large reef pass on the oceanic margin of the northern Great Barrier Reef. Over this period (February 2006-December 2012) tidal state, moon phase and surface seawater temperature were monitored. The timing of sampling was organised to assess variation in physical environment at daily, monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. Over these time scales, temporal patterns of occurrence of 10 species of coral reef fish from 5 families representing 5 defined trophic groups were monitored. The study incorporated 1,357 underwater visual census counts involving 402,370 fish and these estimates were collated with data on tidal state, water temperature, lunar and seasonal periodicity. Aggregated boosted regression trees analysed the univariate responses of fish abundance and species richness to the variation in the physical environment of the reef pass. Flood tides or when water flows from open water through the pass and into the Moore Reef lagoon had 2.3 times as many fish and 1.75 times as many species compared to counts made on ebb tides. Fish abundance was highest in late winter and spring months (Austral calendar), but notably when water temperatures were below the long-term mean of 27 degrees C. Multivariate regression trees and Dufrene-Legendre indicator predicted 4 out of 10 times the occurrence of all 10 species at any temporal scale ranging from hours to years. Flood tides were the principle driver underlying the occurrence of all 10 species regardless of their trophic classification and produced distinct seasonal assemblages, indicative of fishes aggregating to forage and reproduce.

AB The purpose of this descriptive study was to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in participants who voluntarily participated in a fitness assessment, and to examine associations with routine nutrition intake and overall body composition. One hundred and six participants were recruited. Anthropometric measurements were taken with blood analyses completed for fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid panel. A 24-hour diet recall and a dietary screening survey was used to assess nutrient intake, in a sub-set of 36 participants. Statistical analyses utilized partial Spearmans' rank correlations, risk ratios, and Kendall's Tau correlations, with significance level at p < 0.05. Twenty five percent of this sample had >= three risk factors for MetS, with elevated fasting glucose and blood pressure being the most prevalent. Twenty percent of the participants had HbA1c levels elevated at the prediabetes range, with no previous diagnosis. Four percent of participants had HbA1c levels elevated at the T2DM range. Two nutrients of interest were correlated to BMI status. Percent kcal from carbohydrate (tau -0.207, p<0.05) had a negative correlation with BMI status and percent kcal from fat intake had a positive correlation (tau 0.217, p<0.05). Findings from this small sample of adults indicate the need for routine assessment of: clustering of MetS risk factors, risk of prediabetes and T2DM and treatment of same. Many participants would benefit from increasing their participation in physical activity, weight loss in regard to overall health improvement, and education to improve diet quality.

TI The downregulation of IncRNA EMX2OS might independently predict shorter
   recurrence-free survival of classical papillary thyroid cancer
SO PLOS ONE

ID NATURAL ANTISENSE TRANSCRIPT; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA;
   CARCINOMA; GROWTH
AB Homeobox protein Emx2 is a transcription factor that is encoded by the EMX2 gene. In this study, using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Thyroid Cancer (TCGA-THCA), we aimed to examine the expression profile of EMX2 and its antisense transcript EMX2OS in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), their prognostic value and potential regulatory networks. Results showed that in the three variants of PTC, EMX2 was significantly downregulated in classical PTC, while EMX2OS were significantly downregulated in follicular and classical PTC, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that EMX2 and EMX2OS expression was not related to RFS in follicular PTC. In comparison, the high EMX2 or EMX2OS group were associated with better RFS compared with their respective low expression group in classical PTC (p = 0.007 and 0.004 respectively). Correlation analysis showed that EMX2 and EMX2OS were highly co-expressed in PTC tissues (Spearman's r = 0.83). By performing stepwise regression, we found that EMX2OS was better than EMX2 in predicting RFS in classical PTC. Multivariate analysis confirmed that high EMX2OS expression was an independent indicator of favorable RFS in classical PTC (HR: 0.239, 95% CI: 0.100 = 0.569, p = 0.001), after adjustment of pathological stages and residual tumors. By performing in silico analysis, we found that the genes co-expressed with EMX2 or EMX2OS were highly overlapped. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these genes were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling, protein digestion and absorption and proteoglycans in cancer pathways, which are closely related to cancer initiation and progression. Based on the findings, we infer that decreased EMX2OS expression might be a valuable prognostic biomarker of unfavorable RFS in classical PTC.

TI Inside the horn of plenty: Leaf-mining micromoth manipulates its host

AB Leaves represent the main resource for herbivorous insects and their performances are mainly a function of leaf nutritional quality. Two feeding strategies are known to optimize the exploitation of leaf resources: leaf-miners that selectively feed on tissues of high nutritional quality and gall-inducers that induce the development of a new tissue showing an enhanced nutritional value. Some leaf-miners are known to also manipulate their nutritional environment, but do not affect plant development. Cases of callus proliferation in leaf-mines have been reported, however, the direct role of the insect in the formation of additional plant cells and the nutritional function of this tissue have never been established. Using an experimental approach, we show that leaf-mining larvae of micromoth, Borboryctis euryae (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), that grow on Eurya japonica (Pentaphylacaceae), actively induce callus proliferation within their leaf-mine at the fourth instar. We experimentally demonstrated that, at this developmental stage, the larva feeds exclusively on this newly formed tissue and feeding of the tissue is essential for completing larval stage. Phenological census revealed considerable expansion and variation of fourth instar duration caused by the continuous production of callus. We propose here the "cornucopia" hypothesis which states that the newly produced callus induced by the leaf-mining larvae provides virtually unending nourishment, which in turn allows flexible larval development time. This represents the first example of a leaf-miner manipulating plant development to its benefit, like a gall-inducer. We propose to name this life style "mine-galler".

TI The role of KDEL-tailed cysteine endopeptidases of Arabidopsis (AtCEP2

DT Article

   EMERGENCE
AB Plants encode a unique group of papain-type cysteine endopeptidases (CysEP) characterized by a C-terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (KDEL-CysEP) and an unusually broad substrate specificity. The three Arabidopsis KDEL-CysEPs (AtCEP1, AtCEP2, and AtCEP3) are differentially expressed in vegetative and generative tissues undergoing programmed cell death (PCD). While KDEL-CysEPs have been shown to be implicated in the collapse of tissues during PCD, roles of these peptidases in processes other than PCD are unknown. Using mCherry-AtCEP2 and EGFP-AtCEP1 reporter proteins in wild type versus atcep2 or atcep1 mutant plants, we explored the participation of AtCEP in young root development. Loss of AtCEP2, but not AtCEP1 resulted in shorter primary roots due to a decrease in cell length in the lateral root (LR) cap, and impairs extension of primary root epidermis cells such as trichoblasts in the elongation zone. AtCEP2 was localized to root cap corpses adherent to epidermal cells in the rapid elongation zone. AtCEP1 and AtCEP2 are expressed in root epidermis cells that are separated for LR emergence. Loss of AtCEP1 or AtCEP2 caused delayed emergence of LR primordia. KDEL-CysEPs might be involved in developmental tissue remodeling by supporting cell wall elongation and cell separation.

AB Bacillus aquimaris SH6 spores produce carotenoids that are beneficial to white-leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) health. However, the optimal dose and mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood. We investigated the fate of SH6 spores in the gut of L. vannamei. Shrimp were divided into six groups administrated with either feed only (negative control) or SH6 spores at 5 x 10(6) CFU/g pellet (high dose, SH6 spore-H group), 1 x 10(6) CFU/g pellet (medium dose, SH6 spore-M group), 2 x 10(5) CFU/g pellet (low dose, SH6 spore-L group), astaxanthin at 0.5 mg/g pellet (Carophyll group), or carotenoids from SH6 vegetative cells at 5 mu g/g pellet (SH6 carotenoid group). The growth rate was highest in SH6 spore-H (3.38%/day), followed by SH6 spore-M (2.84%/day) and SH6 spore-L (2.25%/day), which was significantly higher than the control (1.45%/day), Carophyll (1.53%/day) or SH6 carotenoid (1.57%/day) groups. The astaxanthin levels (1.9-2.0 mu g/g shrimp) and red-colour scores (21-22) in SH6 spore-H/M were higher than the control (astaxanthin: 1.2 mu g/g shrimp; red score: 20) or SH6 spore-L, but lower than the Carophyll and SH6 carotenoids. Feeding with medium and high doses of SH6 spores after 28 days resulted in respective 1.3-2-fold increases in phenol oxidase activity and 8-9 fold increases in Rho mRNA expression compared to the control and low dose group. The live-counts of SH6 in the gut gradually increased during the 28-day feeding period with SH6 spores at different concentrations, starting from 4.1, 8.2, and 5.4 x 10(4) CFU/g gut at day 1 and reaching 5.3, 5.1, and 4.4 x 10(5) CFU/g gut in the SH6-H/M/L groups, respectively, at day 28. Gut microbiota became more diversified, resulting in a 2-8-fold increase in total bacterial live-counts compared to the controls. SH6 spore germination was detected by measuring the mRNA expression of a specific sequence coding for SH6 amylase at 4 h, reaching saturation at 24 h. Our results confirm that SH6 spores colonize and germinate in the gut to improve the microbial diversity and boost the immune system of shrimp, exhibiting beneficial effects at >1 x 10(6) CFU/g pellet.

AB The outer surface of insects is covered by the cuticle, which is derived from the apical extracellular matrix (aECM). The aECM is secreted by epidermal cells during embryogenesis. The aECM exhibits large variations in structure, function, and constituent molecules, reflecting the enormous diversity in insect appearances. To investigate the molecular principles of aECM organization and function, here we studied the role of a conserved aECM protein, the ZP domain protein Trynity, in Drosophila melanogaster. We first identified trynity as an essential gene for epidermal barrier function. trynity mutation caused disintegration of the outermost envelope layer of the cuticle, resulting in small-molecule leakage and in growth and molting defects. In addition, the tracheal tubules of trynity mutants showed defects in pore-like structures of the cuticle, and the mutant tracheal cells failed to absorb luminal proteins and liquid. Our findings indicated that trynity plays essential roles in organizing nano-level structures in the envelope layer of the cuticle that both restrict molecular trafficking through the epidermis and promote the massive absorption pulse in the trachea.

TI Implicit acoustic sequence learning recruits the hippocampus

DT Article
ID MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION; MEMORY; DISSOCIATION;
   ORDER; TASK; SYSTEMS
AB The exclusive role of the medial temporal lobe in explicit memory has been questioned by several studies reporting medial temporal lobe involvement during implicit learning. Prior studies have demonstrated that hippocampal engagement is present during the implicit learning of perceptual associations, however, it is absent during learning response-related associations. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the function of the medial temporal lobe during implicit learning is related to the extraction of perceptual associations in general. While in most implicit learning tasks visual stimuli were used, the aim of the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to detect whether activations within medial temporal lobe structures are also found during implicit learning of auditory associations. In a modified version of the classical serial reaction time task, participants reacted to the presentation of five different tones. Unbeknownst to the participants, the tones were presented with an underlying sequential regularity that could be learned. To avoid an influence of response learning on acoustic associative learning, response buttons were remapped in every trial. After learning, two different tests were used to measure participants' conscious knowledge about the underlying sequence in order to assess the amount of implicit memory and to exclude participants with explicit knowledge acquired during learning. fMRI results revealed hippocampal activations for implicit learning of the acoustic sequence. When detecting a relation between implicit learning of acoustic associations and hippocampal activations, this study indicated a relation between hippocampal activations and memory formation of perceptual-based relational representation regardless of explicit knowledge. Thus, present findings suggest a general functional role for the formation of sequenced perceptual associations independent of the involvement of awareness.

AB Osteosarcoma (OSA) is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor of the bone that affects children and occurs spontaneously in dogs. Human and canine OSA share similar clinical, biological and genetic features, which make dogs an excellent comparative model to investigate the etiology and pathogenesis of OSA. Mitochondrial (mt) defects have been reported in many different cancers including OSA, although it is not known whether these defects contribute to OSA progression and metastasis. Taking a comparative approach using canine OSA cell lines and tumor tissues we investigated the effects of mtDNA content and dysfunction on OSA biology. OSA tumor tissues had low mtDNA contents compared to the matched non-tumor tissues. We observed mitochondrial heterogeneity among the OSA cell lines and the most invasive cells expressing increased levels of OSA metastasis genes contained the highest amount of mitochondrial defects (reduced mtDNA copies, mt respiration, and expression of electron transport chain proteins). While mitochondria maintain a filamentous network in healthy cells, the mitochondrial morphology in OSA cells were mostly "donut shaped", typical of "stressed" mitochondria. Moreover the expression levels of mitochondrial retrograde signaling proteins Akt1, IGF1R, hnRNPA2 and NFkB correlated with the invasiveness of the OSA cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the causal role of mitochondrial defects in inducing the invasive phenotype by Ethidium Bromide induced-mtDNA depletion in OSA cells. Our data suggest that defects in mitochondrial genome and function are prevalent in OSA and that lower mtDNA content is associated with higher tumor cell invasiveness. We propose that mt defects in OSA might serve as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapeutic intervention in OSA patients.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE; DONATION; ATTITUDE; KNOWLEDGE
AB Background
   In India, annually, 500,000 people die due to non-availability of organs. Given the large proportion of brain death amongst road accident victims, any improvement in organ donation practices amongst this cohort could potentially address this deficit. In this study, we identify the potential areas for intervention to improve organ donation amongst professional drivers, a population more likely to suffer from road accidents.
   Methods
   300 participants were surveyed using a structured, orally-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding organ donation. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify key variables affecting intent to practice.
   Results
   Nearly half our participants had unsatisfactory knowledge and attitude scores. Knowledge and attitude was positively correlated, r(s) (298) = .247, p < .001, with better scores associated with a higher likelihood of intent to practice organ donation [AOR: 2.23 (1.26-3.94), p = .006; AOR: 12.164 (6.85-21.59), p < .001 respectively]. Lack of family support and fear of donated organs going into medical research were the key barriers for the same [AOR: 0.43 (0.19-0.97), p = .04; AOR: 0.27 (0.09-0.85), p = .02 respectively].
   Conclusion
   Targeted health-education, behaviour change communication, and legal interventions, in conjunction, are key to improving organ donor registrations.

AB Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is believed to be a new B vitamin-like compound, and PQQ supplementation has received attention as a possible treatment for diseases including dementia and diabetes. However, the distribution of PQQ in foods is unclear, due to the difficulty in analyzing the compound. Therefore, in this study, enzymatic and LC-MS/MS methods were optimized to enable an accurate analysis of PQQ in foods. The optimized methods were applied to the screening of foods, in which PQQ contents were identified in ng/g or ng/mL levels. Furthermore, we newly found that some foods related to acetic acid bacteria contain PQQ at 1.94 similar to 5.59 ng/mL higher than beer, which is known to contain relatively high amounts of PQQ. These results suggest that the optimized methods are effective for the screening of foods containing PQQ. Such foods with high PQQ content may be valuable as functional foods effective towards the treatment of certain diseases.

TI Liver steatosis and dyslipidemia after HCV eradication by direct acting
   antiviral agents are synergistic risks of atherosclerosis
SO PLOS ONE

   CHOLESTEROL; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; DACLATASVIR
AB Aim
   We comprehensively analyzed how hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication by interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting-antiviral-agents (DAAs) affects liver steatosis and atherogenic risk.
   Methods
   Patients treated with IFN-free-DAAs who underwent transient elastography before and at 24-weeks post-treatment, including controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and achieved sustained viral response (SVR) were enrolled. The association between changes in liver steatosis, lipid-metabolism, and genetic and clinical factors was analyzed.
   Results
   A total of 117 patients were included. The mean CAP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly elevated at SVR24. However, baseline LDL-C and CAP values were significantly negatively correlated with changes in these values after HCV eradication, indicating that in patients with high baseline values, the values generally decreased after HCV eradication. Mean small-dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), which has greater atherogenic potential, was significantly elevated only in patients with both dyslipidemia (LDL-C > 140 mg/dL) and liver steatosis (CAP > 248 dB/m) at SVR24. Those patients had significant higher baseline BMI, LDL-C, and total-cholesterol levels.
   Conclusions
   Generally, successful HCV eradication by IFN-free-DAAs decreases CAP and LDL-C in patients with high baseline values. However, elevated LDL-C was accompanied with elevated sdLDL-C only in patients with liver steatosis and dyslipidemia at SVR24; therefore, those patients may require closer monitoring.

AB The corticospinal system and local spinal circuits control human bipedal locomotion. The primary motor cortex is phase-dependently activated during gait; this cortical input is critical for foot flexor activity during the swing phase. We investigated whether gait-combined rhythmic brain stimulation can induce neuroplasticity in the foot area of the motor cortex and alter gait parameters. Twenty-one healthy subjects participated in the single-blinded, cross-over study. Each subject received anodal transcranial patterned direct current stimulation over the foot area of the right motor cortex during gait, sham stimulation during gait, and anodal transcranial patterned direct current stimulation during rest in a random order. Six subjects were excluded due to a failure in the experimental recording procedure. Complete-case analysis was performed using the data from the remaining 15 subjects. Self-paced gait speed and left leg stride length were significantly increased after the stimulation during gait, but not after the sham stimulation during gait or the stimulation during rest. In addition, a significant increase was found in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway of the left tibialis anterior muscle 30 min after stimulation during gait. Anodal transcranial patterned direct current stimulation during gait entrained the gait cycle to enhance motor cortical activity in some subjects. These findings suggest that the stimulation during gait induced neuroplasticity in corticospinal pathways driving flexor muscles during gait.

AB Background
   Brain volume loss is an important surrogate marker for assessing disability in MS; however, contribution of gray and white matter to the whole brain volume loss needs further examination in the context of specific MS treatment.
   Objectives
   To examine whole and segmented gray, white, thalamic, and corpus callosum volume loss in stable patients receiving natalizumab for 2-5 years.
   Methods
   This was a retrospective study of 20 patients undergoing treatment with natalizumab for 24-68 months. Whole brain volume loss was determined with SIENA. Gray and white matter segmentation was done using FAST. Thalamic and corpus callosum volumes were determined using Freesurfer. T1 relaxation values of chronic hypointense lesions (black holes) were determined using a quantitative, in-house developed method to assess lesion evolution.
   Results
   Over a mean of 36.6 months, median percent brain volume change (PBVC) was -2.0% (IQR 0.99-2.99). There was decline in gray (p = 0.001) but not white matter (p = 0.6), and thalamic (p = 0.01) but not corpus callosum volume (p = 0.09). Gray matter loss correlated with PBVC (Spearman's r = 0.64, p = 0.003) but not white matter (Spearman's r = 0.42, p = 0.07). Age significantly influenced whole brain volume loss (p = 0.010, multivariate regression), but disease duration and baseline T2 lesion volume did not. There was no change in T1 relaxation values of lesions or T2 lesion volume over time. All patients remained clinically stable.
   Conclusions
   These results demonstrate that brain volume loss in MS is primarily driven by gray matter changes and may be independent of clinically effective treatment.

AB Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with most ALRI deaths occurring in children in developing countries. Computational models can be used to test the efficacy of respiratory infection prevention interventions, but require data on social mixing patterns, which are sparse in developing countries. We describe social mixing patterns among a rural community in northern India. During October 2015-February 2016, trained field workers conducted cross-sectional face-to-face standardized surveys in a convenience sample of 330 households in Faridabad District, Haryana State, India. Respondents were asked about the number, duration, and setting of social interactions during the previous 24 hours. Responses were compared by age and gender. Among the 3083 residents who were approached, 2943 (96%) participated, of whom 51% were male and the median age was 22 years (interquartile range (IQR) 9-37). Respondents reported contact (defined as having had a face-to-face conversation within 3 feet, which may or may not have included physical contact) with a median of 17 (IQR 12-25) people during the preceding 24 hours. Median total contact time per person was 36 person-hours (IQR 26-52). Female older children and adults had significantly fewer contacts than males of similar age (Kruskal-Wallis chi 2 = 226.59, p<0.001), but spent a longer duration in contact with young children (Kruskal-Wallis chi 2 = 27.26, p<0.001), suggesting a potentially complex pattern of differential risk of infection between genders. After controlling for household size and day of the week, respondent age was significantly associated with number and duration of contacts. These findings can be used to model the impact of interventions to reduce lower respiratory tract infections in India.

TI Catch and release patterns for target and bycatch species in the

AB The Nordmore grid and the sieve panel are two of the main devices used to reduce fish bycatch in trawl fisheries targeting shrimp species. However, even when using such devices, some small-sized fish enter the codend of the trawl together with the targeted shrimp. Therefore, bycatch reduction remains a problem in some shrimp fisheries. One such fishery is the Northeast Atlantic deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery where it is mandatory to use a Nordmore grid. In this study, the bycatch reduction efficiencies and patterns for several fish species using the standard Nordmore grid and an experimental sieve panel were investigated and compared. The effect of combining these devices was also explored. The bycatch reduction patterns differed significantly between the two devices and a more efficient bycatch reduction was obtained by combining them. However, while the loss of commercial-sized shrimp was only between 0 and 2% for the Nordmore grid, it was between 37 and 56% for the tested sieve panel, making this completely unacceptable for commercial fishing. Therefore, before a sieve panel can be considered as an option for the fishery, other sieve panel designs that have a significantly lower loss of shrimp catches need to be identified.

TI Age at menarche and childhood body mass index as predictors of
   cardio-metabolic risk in young adulthood: A prospective cohort study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION; STATEMENT; GROWTH; BIRTH
AB Objective
   This study aimed to examine the association between age at menarche and a range of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors at 17 and 20 years of age, and whether this was influenced by childhood body mass index (BMI).
   Methods
   Of the 1413 girls born in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, 846 had age at menarche recorded. Subsequently 557 underwent metabolic assessment at 17 years and 541 at 20 years. Associations between age at menarche and cardiovascular risk factors, and being in a high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 and 20 years, or having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years, were investigated by linear mixed effects and logistic regressions, respectively.
   Results
   Each year later of onset of menarche was associated with a 0.75 kg/m(2) reduction in BMI (coefficient -0.75 [95%CI -1.06, -0.44]), and an approximate 30% reduction in the odds of being in the high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 years (OR = 0.73 [95%CI 0.57, 0.94]) and 20 years of age (OR = 0.68 [95%CI 0.52, 0.87]), and a 40% reduction in the odds of having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years (OR = 0.60 [95%CI 0.41, 0.88]). These data show earlier age at menarche was associated with increased BMI and odds of being in the high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 and 20 years, and increased odds of having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years. However, these associations were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for BMI at age 8 years. Current smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status, or hormonal contraceptives use did not affect these associations.
   Conclusions
   Earlier age at menarche may be indicative of a higher risk profile for CVD in young adulthood. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions to reduce BMI in girls who experience menarche at younger age may reduce CVD risk in the future.

AB Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), along with its receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible (Fn) 14, is associated with various biological activities including inflammation. However, its role in the pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which TWEAK regulates inflammatory signaling in orbital fibroblasts from GO patients. We found that TWEAK and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA) mRNA levels were upregulated in GO as compared to non-GO tissue samples. TWEAK, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, TNFR2, and TNFR superfamily member 12A mRNA, and TWEAK and Fn14 protein levels were increased by interleukin (IL)-1 beta and TNF-alpha treatment. Treatment with exogenous recombinant TWEAK increased the transcript and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to a greater extent in GO than in non-GO cells, while treatment with the anti-Fn14 antibody ITEM4 suppressed TWEAK-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release and hyaluronan production. Additionally, the serum level of TWEAK was higher in Graves' disease patients with (341.86 +/- 86.3 pg/ml) as compared to those without (294.09 +/- 41.44 pg/ml) GO and healthy subjects (255.33 +/- 39.38 pg/ml), and was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.629, P < 0.001) and thyroid binding immunoglobulin level (r = 0.659, P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that TWEAK/Fn14 signaling contributes to GO pathogenesis. Moreover, serum TWEAK level is a potential diagnostic biomarker for inflammatory GO, and modulating TWEAK activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy for suppressing inflammation and tissue remodeling in GO.

TI Enhanced pneumothorax visualization in ICU patients using portable chest
   radiography
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID X-RAYS; TUBES
AB Objective
   Pneumothorax development can cause precipitous deterioration in ICU patients, therefore quick and accurate detection is vital. Portable chest radiography is commonly performed to exclude pneumothoraces but is hampered by supine patient position and overlying internal and external material. Also, the initial evaluation of the chest radiograph may be performed by a relatively inexperienced physician. Therefore, a tool that could significantly improve pneumothorax detection on portable radiography would be helpful in patient care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of novel enhancement software for pneumothorax detection in readers with varied clinical experience of detecting/excluding pneumothoraces on portable chest radiographs in ICU patients.
   Subjects and methods
   206 portable ICU chest radiographs, 103 with pneumothoraces, were processed with and without enhancement software and reviewed by 5 readers who varied in reading experience. Images were grouped for different complexity levels.
   Results
   The mean AUC for pneumothorax detection increased for 4/5 readers from 0.846-0.957 to 0.88-0.971 with a largest improvement for the reader with least experience. No significant change was noted for the reader with the longest reading experience. The image complexity had no impact on the interpretation result.
   Conclusion
   Pneumothorax detection improves with novel enhancement software; the largest improvement is seen in less experienced readers.

TI Association between pesticide exposure intensity and self-rated health
   among greenhouse vegetable farmers in Ningxia, China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   POPULATION; DEPRESSION; APPLICATORS; PREDICTOR; WORKERS; ADULTS
AB Background
   Self-rated health (SRH) has been shown to be a stronger comprehensive predictor of health status than the clinical record. Although an association between specific pesticide exposures and health conditions has been reported in different populations, data on the relationship between pesticides exposure intensity (PEI) and SRH in greenhouse farmers is scarce. The aim of the current study was to evaluate this association among vegetable greenhouse farmers in Yinchuan City, western China.
   Methods
   Three consecutive cross-sectional studies were conducted in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. Face-to-face interviews by trained investigators, using questionnaires, were performed. PEI was calculated by a validated method and then categorized into high, middle and low groups. SRH was measured via a single ten-point scale question and then divided into excellent (score >5) and poor SRH (score <= 5). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association. Meanwhile, the dose-response and interaction effects were estimated.
   Results
   A steady association between high PEI and poor SRH (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.28 in the full model) was identified. Although high PEI was significantly associated with poor SRH in males and the Han ethnicity group, no significant association was found with poor SRH in females or those of Hui ethnicity. Interaction effects of education level and frequency of breakfast with PEI were determined (P-interaction = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively); synergistic enhanced effects for poor SRH were observed.
   Conclusion
   These findings indicate that high PEI might be associated with poor SRH among vegetable greenhouse farmers. A lower education level and never eating breakfast contributed to an increased likelihood of poor SRH in those with high PEI. The local government should be making great efforts to promote healthy behaviors and improve protection awareness.

AB Enteric Gram-negative rods (GNR), which are frequent causes of community-acquired and nosocomial infections, are increasingly resistant to the antibiotics in our current armamentarium. One solution to this medical dilemma is the development of novel classes of antimicrobial compounds. Here we report the development of a robust, whole cell-based, high-throughput metabolic assay that detects compounds with activity against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. We have used this assay to screen approximately 8,000 fungal extracts and 50,000 synthetic compounds with the goal of identifying extracts and compounds active against a highly resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The primary screen identified 43 active fungal extracts and 144 active synthetic compounds. Patulin, a known fungal metabolite and inhibitor of bacterial quorum sensing and alanine racemase, was identified as the active component in the most potent fungal extracts. We did not study patulin further due to previously published evidence of toxicity. Three synthetic compounds termed O06, C17, and N08 were chosen for further study. Compound O06 did not have significant antibacterial activity but rather interfered with sugar metabolism, while compound C17 had only moderate activity against GNRs. Compound N08 was active against several resistant GNRs and showed minimal toxicity to mammalian cells. Preliminary studies suggested that it interferes with protein expression. However, its direct application may be limited by susceptibility to efflux and a tendency to form aggregates in aqueous media. Rapid screening of 58,000 test samples with identification of several compounds that act on CR-K. pneumoniae demonstrates the utility of this screen for the discovery of drugs active against this highly resistant GNR.

AB Butterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para-and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.

AB Background
   The real-world data for the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) with or without ribavirin (RBV) in patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCV-1) infection remain limited in Taiwan.
   Methods
   A total of 273 chronic HCV-1 patients receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks of SOF/LDV with or without RBV were enrolled. The sustained virologic response rate at week 12 off-therapy (SVR12) by evaluable population (EP) and per-protocol population (PP) were assessed for effectiveness. The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) and serious AE rate were assessed for safety. Baseline patient characteristics and on-treatment HCV viral kinetics associated with SVR12 were analyzed.
   Results
   The SVR12 rates by EP and PP analyses were 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.9%-98.3%) and 97.5% (95% CI: 94.8%-98.8%), respectively. The rates of treatment discontinuation due to AE and serious AE were 0.4% and 4.4%, respectively. Seven patients with true virologic failure were relapsers. In 2 patients who were lost-to follow-up, one expired at treatment week 3 due to pneumonia which was considered not related to treatment, and one declined follow-up at off-therapy week 4. The SVR12 rates were comparable in terms of baseline patient characteristics and viral decline at week 4 of treatment.
   Conclusions
   SOF/LDV with or without RBV for 8-24 weeks is well tolerated and achieves a high SVR12 rate in patients with HCV-1 infection in Taiwan.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked the third most common cancer in human worldwide. However, the exact mechanisms of CRC are not well established. Furthermore, there may be differences between mechanisms of CRC in the Asian and in the Western populations. In the present study, we utilized a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic approach supported by the 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing to investigate the functional and taxonomical differences between paired tumor and unaffected (normal) surgical biopsy tissues from 17 Malaysian patients. Metabolomic differences associated with steroid biosynthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis and bile metabolism could be attributed to microbiome differences between normal and tumor sites. The relative abundances of Anaerotruncus, Intestinimonas and Oscillibacter displayed significant relationships with both steroid biosynthesis and terpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways. Metabolites involved in serotonergic synapse/tryptophan metabolism (Serotonin and 5-Hydroxy-3indoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) were only detected in normal tissue samples. On the other hand, S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), a metabolite involves in methionine metabolism and methylation, was frequently increased in tumor relative to normal tissues. In conclusion, this study suggests that local microbiome dysbiosis may contribute to functional changes at the cancer sites. Results from the current study also contributed to the list of metabolites that are found to differ between normal and tumor sites in CRC and supported our quest for understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

AB The viridans group streptococci comprise multiple species and have gained more recognition in recent years as common etiologic agents of bacterial endophthalmitis. The purpose of this study was to identify the species of human endophthalmitis isolates of viridans streptococci and to characterize their potential virulence attributes. The species of 22 endophthalmitis strains of viridans streptococci were identified by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight. Susceptibilities to 3 antibiotics commonly used for bacterial endophthalmitis were determined. The extracellular milieu of each strain was tested for cytotoxicity of retinal pigmented epithelial cells, hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, and protease activity using gelatin zymography. Identified species were Streptococcus mitis/oralis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. parasanguinis, S. mutans, S. constellatus, and S. gordonii. One strain of S. pseudoporcinus was also identified. All strains were sensitive to vancomycin, 77% were resistant to amikacin, and 27% had intermediate resistance to ceftazidime. Extracellular milieu from all strains except one (S. pseudoporcinus) were largely devoid of toxicity to retinal pigmented epithelial cells and sheep erythrocytes. Twelve strains, 10 of which were S. mitis/oralis, produced protease activity. Interestingly, not all of the S. mitis/oralis strains were proteolytic. These findings highlight the diversity of virulence factor production in ocular strains of the viridans streptococci not only at the group level but also at the species level.

AB Previous studies have shown that a cytosine (C) to thymine (T) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene is associated with positive emotional processing. C allele carriers are more sensitive to positive emotional stimuli including happiness. The effects of several gene polymorphisms related to sensitivity to emotional stimuli, such as that in the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR), on emotional processing have been reported to differ among cultures-e.g., between those that are independent and interdependent. Thus, we postulated that the effects of the CNR1 genotype on happiness might differ among different cultures because the concept of happiness varies by culture. We recruited healthy male and female young adults in Japan, where favorable external circumstances determine the concept of happiness, and Canada, where the concept of happiness centers on positive inner feelings, and compared the effects of the CNR1 genotype on both subjective happiness levels (self-evaluation as being a happy person) and situation-specific happiness (happy feelings accompanying various positive events) by using a questionnaire. We found that the effect of CNR1 on subjective happiness was different between the Japanese and Canadian groups. The subjective happiness level was the highest in Japanese individuals with the CC genotype, whereas in Canadian participants, it was the highest in individuals with the TT genotype. Furthermore, the effects of CNR1 genotype on situation-specific happiness were also different between the groups. Happiness accompanied with being surrounded by happy people was the highest among Japanese individuals with the CC genotype, whereas among Canadian individuals, it was the highest in TT genotype carriers. These findings suggest that culture and CNR1 polymorphism interact to influence the perception of happiness.

TI Effects of RNA structure and salt concentration on the affinity and
   kinetics of interactions between pentatricopeptide repeat proteins and
   their RNA ligands
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SINGLE-STRANDED RNA; EDITING FACTORS; BINDING; RECOGNITION; STABILITY;
   MECHANISM; TERMINI
AB Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are helical repeat proteins that bind specific RNA sequences via modular 1-repeat: 1-nucleotide interactions. Binding specificity is dictated, in part, by hydrogen bonds between the amino acids at two positions in each PPR motif and the Watson-Crick face of the aligned nucleobase. There is evidence that PPR-RNA interactions can compete with RNA-RNA interactions in vivo, and that this competition underlies some effects of PPR proteins on gene expression. Conversely, RNA secondary structure can inhibit the binding of a PPR protein to its specific binding site. The parameters that influence whether PPR-RNA or RNA-RNA interactions prevail are unknown. Understanding these parameters will be important for understanding the functions of natural PPR proteins and for the design of engineered PPR proteins for synthetic biology purposes. We addressed this question by analyzing the effects of RNA structures of varying stability and position on the binding of the model protein PPR10 to its atpH RNA ligand. Our results show that even very weak RNA structures (Delta G degrees similar to 0 kcal/mol) involving only one nucleotide at either end of the minimal binding site impede PPR10 binding. Analysis of binding kinetics using Surface Plasmon Resonance showed that RNA structures reduce PPR10's on-rate and increase its off-rate. Complexes between the PPR proteins PPR10 and HCF152 and their respective RNA ligands have long half-lives (one hour or more), correlating with their functions as barriers to exonucleolytic RNA decay in vivo. The effects of salt concentration on PPR10-RNA binding kinetics showed that electrostatic interactions play an important role in establishing PPR10-RNA interactions but play a relatively small role in maintaining specific interactions once established.

   QUANTIFICATION
AB The burden of liver disease continues to increase in the UK, with liver cirrhosis reported to be the third most common cause of premature death. Iron overload, a condition that impacts liver health, was traditionally associated with genetic disorders such as hereditary haemochromatosis, however, it is now increasingly associated with obesity, type-2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of elevated levels of liver iron within the UK Biobank imaging study in a cohort of 9108 individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken at the UK Biobank imaging centre, acquiring a multi-echo spoiled gradient-echo single-breath-hold MRI sequence from the liver. All images were analysed for liver iron and fat (expressed as proton density fat fraction or PDFF) content using LiverMultiScan. Liver iron was measured in 97.3% of the cohort. The mean liver iron content was 1.32 +/- 0.32 mg/g while the median was 1.25 mg/g (min: 0.85 max: 6.44 mg/g). Overall 4.82% of the population were defined as having elevated liver iron, above commonly accepted 1.8 mg/g threshold based on biochemical iron measurements in liver specimens obtained by biopsy. Further analysis using univariate models showed elevated liver iron to be related to male sex (p<10(-16), r(2) = 0.008), increasing age (p<10(-16), r(2) = 0.013), and red meat intake (p<10(-16), r(2) = 0.008). Elevated liver fat (>5.6% PDFF) was associated with a slight increase in prevalence of elevated liver iron (4.4% vs 6.3%, p = 0.0007). This study shows that population studies including measurement of liver iron concentration are feasible, which may in future be used to better inform patient stratification and treatment.

AB Analysing the effect water temperature has on Daphnia magna is essential in anticipating the impact climate change will have on this freshwater zooplanktonic keystone species. While many authors have followed this line of research, few have covered an extensive temperature range or complex temperature change scenarios. Global warming is mostly associated with increased extreme temperature events, such as heat waves, as well as earlier and more intense thermal stratification. Both of these events may directly influence D. magna fitness, especially in those populations performing diel vertical migration (DVM). We analysed the effect water temperatures, ranging from 11 to 29 degrees C, have on the filtration capacity (FC) of D. magna, to anticipate the effects of acclimation, temperature change rate (TCR) and potential reversibility of responses to such conditions. Results show that sudden temperature changes have an immediate negative impact on the FC of D. magna and is more severe at higher temperatures and higher TCRs. However, D. magna individuals have shown themselves to be capable of quasi-acclimating to temperatures ranging from 11 to 25 degrees C in around a week and achieving much higher FCs; albeit never reaching the optimal FC achieved at 20 degrees C. That said, 29 degrees C is lethal for D. magna individuals within approximately five days. Finally, non-optimal temperature acclimated individuals can recover maximal FC within 2-4 days of the optimal long-term acclimation temperature (20 degrees C) being re-established, thus proving temperature responses to be reversible.

TI Ureteral dilatation detected in magnetic resonance imaging predicts
   vesicoureteral reflux in children with urinary tract infection
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS; FEBRILE INFANTS; DIAGNOSIS; MRI; UTI
AB Objective
   Urinary tract infection (UTI), one of the most common bacterial infections occurring during infancy and early childhood, is frequently associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Although several guidelines recommend performing ultrasonography as a screening test, its utility is not adequate and appropriate screening tests are strongly desirable. In this study, we evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a screening test for VUR in children with UTI.
   Methods
   We prospectively studied 108 patients with suspected UTI between April 2014 and March 2016. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and urine culture findings. We measured ureteral dilatation using MRI in 96 patients with UTI and assessed the relationship between ureteral dilatation in MRI and VUR in 46 patients who underwent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).
   Results
   Among 108 patients, 88 and 8 were diagnosed with upper and lower UTI, respectively. Among 46 patients who underwent VCUG, 23 had VUR (14 low grade and 9 high grade). Patients with ureteral dilatation detected on MRI had VUR more frequently than those without ureteral dilatation (any grades VUR, 71% vs. 32%; P = 0.02; high-grade VUR, 38% vs. 2%, P = 0.007). Overall, ureteral dilatation findings on MRI achieved sensitivity 65.2% and specificity 73.9% as a screening test for VUR. In addition, DW-MRI achieved sensitivity 100% and specificity 81.8% in the diagnosis of upper UTI.
   Conclusion
   These findings suggested that MRI is a valuable tool for screening of VUR as well as diagnosis of upper UTI.

TI Chaotic attractor hopping yields logic operations
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; NOISE; GATE; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Certain nonlinear systems can switch between dynamical attractors occupying different regions of phase space, under variation of parameters or initial states. In this work we exploit this feature to obtain reliable logic operations. With logic output 0/1 mapped to dynamical attractors bounded in distinct regions of phase space, and logic inputs encoded by a very small bias parameter, we explicitly demonstrate that the system hops consistently in response to an external input stream, operating effectively as a reliable logic gate. This system offers the advantage that very low-amplitude inputs yield highly amplified outputs. Additionally, different dynamical variables in the system yield complementary logic operations in parallel. Further, we show that in certain parameter regions noise aids the reliability of logic operations, and is actually necessary for obtaining consistent outputs. This leads us to a generalization of the concept of Logical Stochastic Resonance to attractors more complex than fixed point states, such as periodic or chaotic attractors. Lastly, the results are verified in electronic circuit experiments, demonstrating the robustness of the phenomena. So we have combined the research directions of Chaos Computing and Logical Stochastic Resonance here, and this approach has potential to be realized in wide-ranging systems.

AB Tussocks are unique vegetation structures in wetlands. Many tussock species mainly reproduce by clonal growth, resulting in genetically identical offspring distributed in various spatial patterns. These fine-scale patterns could influence mating patterns and thus the long-term evolution of wetland plants. Here, we contribute the first genetic and clonal structures of two key species in alpine wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Kobresia tibetica and Blysmus sinocompressus, using > 5000 SNPs identified by 2b-RAD sequencing. The tussock-building species, K. tibetica, has a phalanx (clumping) growth form, but different genets could cooccur within the tussocks, indicating that it is not proper to treat a tussock as one genetic individual. Phalanx growth does not necessarily lead to increased inbreeding in K. tibetica. B. sinocompressus has a guerilla (spreading) growth form, with the largest detected clone size being 18.32 m, but genets at the local scale tend to be inbred offspring. Our results highlight that the combination of clone expansion and seedling recruitment facilitates the contemporary advantage of B. sinocompressus, but its evolutionary potential is limited by the input genetic load of the original genets. The tussocks of K. tibetica are more diverse and a valuable genetic legacy of former well-developed wet meadows, and they are worthy of conservation attention.

TI Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in ambient urban dust
   drive proinflammatory T cell and dendritic cell responses via the aryl

AB Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is a complex component of air pollution that is a composed of inorganic and organic constituents. The chemically-extracted organic fraction (OF) of PM excludes inorganics but retains most organic constituents like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are ubiquitous environmental toxicants and known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. The AHR is a ligand activated transcription factor that responds to endogenous ligands and exogenous ligands including PAHs. Activation of the AHR leads to upregulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolizing enzymes which are important for the biotransformation of toxicants to less toxic, or in the case of PAHs, more toxic intermediates. Additionally, the AHR plays an important role in balancing regulatory and effector T cell responses. This study aimed to determine whether PAHs present in PM aggravate inflammation by driving inflammatory T cell and dendritic cell (DC) responses and their mechanism of action. This study tests the hypothesis that PAHs present in PM activate the AHR and alter the immune balance shifting from regulation to inflammation. To test this, the effects of SRM1649b OF on T cell differentiation and DC function were measured in vitro. SRM1649b OF enhanced Th17 differentiation in an AHR and CYP-dependent manner and increased the percent of IFN gamma positive DCs in an AHR-dependent manner. SRM1649b PAH mixtures enhanced Th17 differentiation in an AHR-dependent but CYP-independent manner and increased the percent of IFN gamma positive DCs. Cumulatively, these results suggest that PAHs present in PM are active components that contribute to immune responses in both T cells and BMDCs through the AHR and CYP metabolism. Understanding the role of AHR and CYP metabolism of PAHs in immune cells after PM exposure will shed light on new targets that will shift the immune balance from inflammation to regulation.

AB Cognitive decline is a common occurrence of the natural aging process in animals and studying age-related changes in gene expression in the brain might shed light on disrupted molecular pathways that play a role in this decline. The fruit fly is a useful neurobiological model for studying aging due to its short generational time and relatively small brain size. We investigated age-dependent changes in the Drosophila melanogaster whole-brain transcriptome by comparing 5-, 20-, 30- and 40-day-old flies of both sexes. We used RNA-Sequencing of dissected brain samples followed by differential expression, temporal clustering, co-expression network and gene ontology enrichment analyses. We found an overall decline in expression of genes from the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway that occurred as part of aging. We also detected, in females, a pattern of continuously declining expression for many neuronal function genes, which was unexpectedly reversed later in life. This group of genes was highly enriched in memory-impairing genes previously identified through an RNAi screen. We also identified deficits in short-term olfactory memory performance in older flies of both sexes, some of which matched the timing of certain changes in the brain transcriptome. Our study provides the first transcriptome profile of aging brains from fruit flies of both sexes, and it will serve as an important resource for those who study aging and cognitive decline in this model.

AB Within current theories on potential adaptive manipulation of offspring sex ratio, giving birth to a male or to a female is assumed to depend on the capacity of the mother to invest in offspring to maximize her fitness. The active role of the father in sex ratio bias at birth has been neglected until recently. The human sex ratio at birth is biased towards sons, although in occidental populations, the ratio has decreased regularly for 30 years and could be the consequence of the adverse effects of environmental chemicals on male hormones. In a Malagasy primate, the lesser mouse lemur, the potential effect of paternal testosterone levels on sex ratio bias at birth was tested on 130 litters (278 babies) produced in 52 mixed-sex groups. For each group, social dominance among males was characterized based on aggressive interactions and sexual behaviours. Using a multi correspondence analysis, high testosterone levels in grouped males, particularly those of the dominant male, were significantly correlated with more infants produced in male-biased litters, independent of the female condition. According to these results, predictions for sex ratio bias towards one sex or the other in mouse lemurs were discussed considering the influence of both parents.

AB Information forms the basis for all human behavior, including the ubiquitous decision-making that people constantly perform in their every day lives. It is thus the mission of researchers to understand how humans process information to reach decisions. In order to facilitate this task, this work proposes LASSO regularization as a statistical tool to extract decisive words from textual content in order to study the reception of granular expressions in natural language. This differs from the usual use of the LASSO as a predictive model and, instead, yields highly interpretable statistical inferences between the occurrences of words and an outcome variable. Accordingly, the method suggests direct implications for the social sciences: it serves as a statistical procedure for generating domain-specific dictionaries as opposed to frequently employed heuristics. In addition, researchers can now identify text segments and word choices that are statistically decisive to authors or readers and, based on this knowledge, test hypotheses from behavioral research.

TI The synergism of high-intensity intermittent exercise and

AB Visceral lipid accumulation, organ hypertrophy and a reduction in skeletal muscle strength are all signs associated with the severity of obesity-related disease. Intermittent fasting (IF) and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) are natural strategies that, individually, can prevent and help treat obesity along with metabolic syndrome and its associated diseases. However, the combinatorial effect of IF and HIIE on energetic metabolism is currently not well understood. We hypothesized that their combination could have a potential for more than strictly additive benefits. Here, we show that two months of every-other-day intermittent fasting regimen combined with a high-intensity intermittent exercise protocol (IF/HIIE) produced a synergistic effect, enhancing physical endurance (vs. control, HIIE and IF) and optimizing metabolic pathways of energy production in male Wistar rats. The IF/HIIE group presented enhanced glucose tolerance (vs. control, HIIE and IF), lower levels of plasma insulin (vs. control and HIIE), and a global activation of low Km hexokinases in liver (vs. control, HIIE and IF), heart (vs. control and HIIE) and skeletal muscle (vs. control, HIIE and IF). The IF/HIIE synergism, rather than a simply additive effect, is evidenced by increase in muscle mass and cross-section area, activation of the FoF1 ATP synthase, and the gain of characteristics suggestive of augmented mitochondrial mass and efficiency observed in this group. Finally, important reductions in plasma oxidative stress markers were present preferentially in IF/HIIE group. These findings provide new insights for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical strategies to prevent/treat metabolic syndrome and associated diseases.

AB Intact red blood cells (RBCs) are required for phenotypic analyses. In order to allow separation (time and location) between subject encounter and sample analysis, we developed a research-specific RBC cryopreservation protocol and assessed its impact on data fidelity for key biochemical and physiological assays. RBCs drawn from healthy volunteers were aliquotted for immediate analysis or following glycerol-based cryopreservation, thawing, and deglycerolization. RBC phenotype was assessed by (1) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and standard morphometric RBC indices, (2) osmotic fragility, (3) deformability, (4) endothelial adhesion, (5) oxygen (O-2) affinity, (6) ability to regulate hypoxic vasodilation, (7) nitric oxide (NO) content, (8) metabolomic phenotyping (at steady state, tracing with [1,2,3-C-13(3)]glucose +/- oxidative challenge with superoxide thermal source; SOTS-1), as well as in vivo quantification (following human to mouse RBC xenotransfusion) of (9) blood oxygenation content mapping and flow dynamics (velocity and adhesion). Our revised glycerolization protocol (40% v/v final) resulted in >98.5% RBC recovery following freezing (-80 degrees C) and thawing (37 degrees C), with no difference compared to the standard reported method (40% w/v final). Full deglycerolization (>99.9% glycerol removal) of 40% v/v final samples resulted in total cumulative lysis of similar to 8%, compared to similar to 12-15% with the standard method. The post cryopreservation/deglycerolization RBC phenotype was indistinguishable from that for fresh RBCs with regard to physical RBC parameters (morphology, volume, and density), osmotic fragility, deformability, endothelial adhesivity, O-2 affinity, vasoregulation, metabolomics, and flow dynamics. These results indicate that RBC cryopreservation/deglycerolization in 40% v/v glycerol final does not significantly impact RBC phenotype (compared to fresh cells).

TI Plant evolution in alkaline magnesium-rich soils: A phylogenetic study

   on nuclear and plastid sequences

AB Habitats with alkaline edaphic substrates are often associated with plant speciation and diversification. The tribe Alysseae, in the family Brassicaceae, epitomizes this evolutionary trend. In this lineage, some genera, like Hormathophylla, can serve as a good case for testing the evolutionary framework. This genus is centered in the western Mediterranean. It grows on different substrates, but mostly on alkaline soils. It has been suggested that diversification in many lineages of the tribe Alysseae and in the genus Hormathophylla is linked to a tolerance for high levels of Mg + 2 in xeric environments. In this study, we investigated the controversial phylogenetic placement of Hormathophylla in the tribe, the generic limits and the evolutionary relationships between the species using ribosomal and plastid DNA sequences. We also examined the putative association between the evolution of different ploidy levels, trichome morphology and the type of substrates. Our analyses demonstrated the monophyly of the genus Hormathophylla including all previously described species. Nuclear sequences revealed two lineages that differ in basic chromosome numbers (x = 7 and x = 8 or derived 11, 15) and in their trichome morphology. Contrasting results with plastid genes indicates more complex relationships between these two lineages involving recent hybridization processes. We also found an association between chloroplast haplotypes and substrate, especially in populations growing on dolomites. Finally, our dated phylogeny demonstrates that the origin of the genus took place in the mid-Miocene, during the establishment of temporal land bridges between the Tethys and Paratethys seas, with a later diversification during the upper Pliocene.

TI Suitability of a new Bloom filter for numerical vectors with high
   dimensions
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The notable increase in the size and dimensions of data have presented challenges for data storage and retrieval. The Bloom filter and its generations, due to efficient space overheads and constant query delays, have been broadly applied to querying memberships of a big data set. However, the Bloom filter and most of the variants regard each element as a 1-dimensional string and adopt multiple different string hashes to project the data. The interesting problem is when the inputs are numerical vectors with high dimensions, it remains unknown whether they can be projected into the Bloom filter in their original format. Furthermore, we investigate whether the projection is random and uniform. To address these problems, this paper presents a new uniform Prime-HD-BKDERhash family and a new Bloom filter (P-HDBF) to retrieve the membership of a big data set with the numerical high dimensions. Since the randomness and uniformity of data mapping determines the performance of the Bloom filter, to verify these properties, we first introduce information entropy. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the P-HDBF can randomly and uniformly map the data in their native formats. Moreover, the P-HDBF provides an efficient solution alternative to implement membership search with space-time overheads. This advantage may be suitable for engineering applications that are resource-constrained or identification of the nuances of the graphics and images.

AB Background
   A group of Russian scientists has developed Diaskintest, which comprises Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific recombinant proteins CFP10-ESAT6, for skin testing (0.2 mu g/0.1 ml).
   Study purpose
   To evaluate the comparative sensitivity of TST with 2 TU PPD-L and a skin test with tuberculous recombinant allergen (Diaskintest) containing the ESAT6-CFP10 protein in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed active tuberculosis during mass screening in the primary medical service in Moscow.
   Materials and methods
   The trial was a comprehensive retrospective group study of children and adolescents diagnosed in Moscow with active tuberculosis in 2013-2016, aged 0 to 17 years inclusive.
   Results
   From 441 patients selected for analysis 408 patients had both tests (TST with 2 TU PPD-L and Diaskintest) performed, in 193 patients both tests were given simultaneously, of them 162 patients were BCG-vaccinated. Comparative results of both tests in 408 patients with tuberculosis: at cut-off >= 5 mm, both tests has similar sensitivity: Diaskintest 98.3% (95% CI 97.0-99.6%), TST 98.0% (95% CI 96.7-99.4%), at cut-off. 10 mm, the sensitivity decreases for both tests: Diaskintest 90.0% (95% CI 87.0-93.0%), TST 88.7% (95% CI 85.6-91.9%), but at cut-off >= 15 mm, the decrease in sensitivity is statistically significant: for Diaskintest 61.5% (95% CI 56.7-66.3%), and for TST 46.3% (95% CI 41.4-51.3%), p < 0.0001.
   The results of simultaneous setting of tests on different hands in 193 people (including 162 BCG-vaccinated), do not differ from the results for 408 people.
   The correlation between the results of Diaskintest and TST was significant in all groups.
   Conclusion
   In children and adolescents with active tuberculosis, Diaskintest of 0.2 mu g/ml and the Mantoux test with 2 TU PPD-L have high sensitivity (98%) at a cut-off of 5 mm; however, at cutoff. 15 mm sensitivity is significantly reduced, and the decrease is more pronounced in the Mantoux test. The advantage of Diaskintest is that, unlike the Mantoux test, it has high specificity under the conditions of mass BCG vaccination. The test is simple to carry out, and can be used in mass screening.

Births were identified from California birth certificate and hospital discharge records from 2007-2012 (N = 2,865,987). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks completed gestation and dyslipidemia was defined by diagnostic codes. Subtypes of preterm birth were classified as preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), spontaneous labor, and medically indicated, according to birth certificate data and diagnostic codes. The association between dyslipidemia and preterm birth was tested with logistic regression. Models were adjusted for maternal age at delivery, race/ethnicity, hypertension, pre-pregnancy body mass index, insurance type, and education. Maternal dyslipidemia was significantly associated with increased odds of preterm birth (adjusted OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.59). This finding was consistent across all subtypes of preterm birth, including PPROM (adjusted OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.76), spontaneous (adjusted OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.65), and medically indicated (adjusted OR: 1.454, 95% CI: 1.282, 1.649). This study suggests that maternal dyslipidemia is associated with increased risk for all types of preterm birth.

TI Dietary quality of predominantly traditional diets is associated with
   blood glucose profiles, but not with total fecal Bifidobacterium in
   Indonesian women

   INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA; ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE; LIFE-STYLE; LOW-INCOME;
   OBESITY; INFLAMMATION
AB Background
   A high quality modern diet is associated with reduced risk of metabolic disease and diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether the quality of predominantly traditional ethnic diets is associated with such conditions. Moreover, the relationship between dietary quality and microbiota, a potential mediator of metabolic disease, has not been studied.
   Objective
   We investigated the relationship of dietary quality of traditional ethnic diets in Indonesia with fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, and the number of fecal Bifidobacterium.
   Design
   A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts with predominantly animal-or plant-based traditional diets of West Sumatera and West Java provinces, respectively. A total of 240 apparently healthy women aged 19-50 years were randomly selected from 360 women screened by a cluster sampling design. Dietary quality was assessed by 2-day repeated 24-hour food recall, and scored using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010. FBG was quantified with the enzymatic colorimetric method, and HbA1c by using hexokinase and high-performance liquid chromatography, and total fecal Bifidobacterium by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
   Results
   The HEI scores of 99% of women were < 51, indicating a low-quality diet. In adjusted multi-variate regression, HEI was inversely associated with FBG (beta = -0.403; 95% CI = -0.789 to -0.016; p = 0.041) and HbA1c (beta = -0.018; 95% CI = -0.036 to 0.000; p = 0.048) but was not significantly associated with total levels of Bifidobacterium (beta = -0.007, p = 0.275). Bifidobacterium count was not significantly associated with either FBG or HbA1c levels.
   Conclusion
   Low dietary quality is clearly associated with risk of increased markers of blood glucose. However, any mediating role of Bifidobacterium between dietary quality and glucose outcomes was not apparent. Innovative interventions for healthy eating should be implemented to increase dietary quality of populations transitioning from predominantly traditional to modern diets, to reduce the risk of diabetes, especially in women.

AB We present sample transfer instrumentation and integrated protocols for the preparation and atom probe characterization of environmentally-sensitive materials. Ultra-high vacuum cryogenic suitcases allow specimen transfer between preparation, processing and several imaging platforms without exposure to atmospheric contamination. For expedient transfers, we installed a fast-docking station equipped with a cryogenic pump upon three systems; two atom probes, a scanning electron microscope / Xe-plasma focused ion beam and a N-2-atmosphere glovebox. We also installed a plasma FIB with a solid-state cooling stage to reduce beam damage and contamination, through reducing chemical activity and with the cryogenic components as passive cryogenic traps. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new laboratory protocols by the successful preparation and transfer of two highly contamination-and temperature-sensitive samples-water and ice. Analysing pure magnesium atom probe data, we show that surface oxidation can be effectively suppressed using an entirely cryogenic protocol (during specimen preparation and during transfer). Starting with the cryogenically-cooled plasma FIB, we also prepared and transferred frozen ice samples while avoiding significant melting or sublimation, suggesting that we may be able to measure the nanostructure of other normally-liquid or soft materials. Isolated cryogenic protocols within the N-2 glove box demonstrate the absence of ice condensation suggesting that environmental control can commence from fabrication until atom probe analysis.

   GRIEF; TRAUMATIC BEREAVEMENT; TSUNAMI; PREVALENCE; IMPACT;
   SYMPTOMATOLOGY; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS
AB Background
   The long-term trajectories of prolonged grief are poorly understood. The aims were to examine the course of grief among bereaved disaster survivors up to six years post loss and factors predicting worse bereavement outcome. A third aim was to explore differences in grief indicators between trajectories.
   Methods
   Bereaved Swedish tourists who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis responded to surveys including the Inventory of Complicated Grief 1 to 6 years after the disaster. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify longitudinal trajectories of grief. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of class membership.
   Results
   Three trajectories were identified: resilient (41% of the sample), recovering (48%), and chronic (11%). The strongest predictor of chronic grief was the loss of one's child. When examining grief indicators, the chronic trajectory was characterized by not accepting the loss, while yearning was common in all trajectories.
   Conclusions
   This study highlights the importance of considering how traumatically bereaved individuals can be affected by loss for several years after a disaster, especially after losing one's child. An inability to accept the loss, more so than yearning, appears to characterize bereaved survivors at risk of a chronic trajectory of grief.

TI Adenosine stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis via adrenal glands-liver
   crosstalk in mice
SO PLOS ONE

ID RECEPTORS; TRANSPORT; INCREASES; INSULIN; TISSUE
AB Adenosine signaling is involved in glucose metabolism in hepatocytes and myocytes in vitro. However, no information is available regarding the effect of adenosine on glucose metabolism in vivo. Thus, we examined how extracellular adenosine acts on glucose metabolism using mice. Subcutaneous injections of adenosine (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg bodyweight) dose-dependently increased blood glucose levels, with the peak occurring at 30 min post injection. At 30 min after adenosine injection (25 mg/kg bodyweight), glycogen content in the liver, but not the skeletal muscle, was significantly decreased. Hepatic glycogen depletion by fasting for 12 h suppressed the increase of blood glucose levels at 30 min after adenosine injection. These results suggest that adenosine increases blood glucose levels by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis. To investigate the effect of adenosine on the adrenal gland, we studied the glycogenolysis signal in adrenalectomized (ADX) mice. Adenosine significantly increased the blood glucose levels in sham mice but not in the ADX mice. The decrease in hepatic glycogen content induced by adenosine in the sham mice was partially suppressed in the ADX mice. The level of plasma corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid in mice, was significantly increased in the sham mice by adenosine but its levels were low in ADX mice injected with either PBS or adenosine. These results suggest that adenosine promotes secretion of corticosterone from the adrenal glands, which causes hepatic glycogenolysis and subsequently the elevation of blood glucose levels. Our findings are useful for clarifying the physiological functions of adenosine in glucose metabolism in vivo.

AB Chromosome organization during cell division is achieved through the timely association of proteins with chromatin and is regulated by protein phosphorylation. Kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A) plays an important role in the chromosome organization through the formation of the chromosome scaffold structure. However, the relationship between the function of KIF4A and its phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of KIF4A at S1186 is required for chromosome binding and chromosome scaffold formation. The KIF4A mutant, which is not phosphorylated at S1186, was found to localize to the nucleus during interphase but did not accumulate in the chromosome scaffold after nuclear envelope breakdown. In addition, defects in KIF4A phosphorylation were found to disrupt the interaction of KIF4A with the condensin I complex. As a result, the morphology of the chromosomes was observed to be laterally decondensed, without condensin I in the chromosome scaffold. Additionally, a defect in chromosome segregation, chromosome bridge formation, was often observed. Although both KIF4A and condensin I disappeared from the chromosomes, the chromosomal localization of condensin II was not affected. Collectively, our novel results revealed that Cdk1-dependent KIF4A phosphorylation at S1186 is a trigger for chromosomal organization during early mitosis.

ID RANDOM PROJECTION; JOHNSON-LINDENSTRAUSS; MATRIX; NOISE
AB In a very high-dimensional vector space, two randomly-chosen vectors are almost orthogonal with high probability. Starting from this observation, we develop a statistical factor model, the random factor model, in which factors are chosen stochastically based on the random projection method. Randomness of factors has the consequence that correlation and covariance matrices are well preserved in a linear factor representation. It also enables derivation of probabilistic bounds for the accuracy of the random factor representation of time-series, their cross-correlations and covariances. As an application, we analyze reproduction of time-series and their cross-correlation coefficients in the well-diversified Russell 3,000 equity index.

AB Governments, development banks, corporations, and nonprofits are increasingly considering the potential contribution of watershed conservation activities to secure clean water for cities and to reduce flood risk. These organizations, however, often lack decision-relevant, initial screening information across multiple cities to identify which specific city-watershed combinations present not only water-related risks but also potentially attractive opportunities for mitigation via natural infrastructure approaches. To address this need, this paper presents a novel methodology for a continental assessment of the potential for watershed conservation activities to improve surface drinking water quality and mitigate riverine and stormwater flood risks in 70 major cities across Latin America. We used publicly available geospatial data to analyze 887 associated watersheds. Water quality metrics assessed the potential for agricultural practices, afforestation, riparian buffers, and forest conservation to mitigate sediment and phosphorus loads. Flood reduction metrics analyzed the role of increasing infiltration, restoring riparian wetlands, and reducing connected impervious surface to mitigate riverine and stormwater floods for exposed urban populations. Cities were then categorized based on relative opportunity potential to reduce identified risks through watershed conservation activities. We find high opportunities for watershed activities to mitigate at least one of the risks in 42 cities, potentially benefiting 96 million people or around 60% of the urbanites living in the 70 largest cities in Latin America. We estimate water quality could be improved for 72 million people in 27 cities, riverine flood risk mitigated for 5 million people in 13 cities, and stormwater flooding mitigated for 44 million people in 14 cities. We identified five cities with the potential to simultaneously enhance water quality and mitigate flood risks, and in contrast, six cities where conservation efforts are unlikely to meaningfully mitigate either risk. Institutions investing in natural infrastructure to improve water security in Latin America can maximize their impact by focusing on specific watershed conservation activities either for cleaner drinking water or flood mitigation in cities identified in our analysis where these interventions are most likely to reduce risk.

ID VIRUS; OUTBREAK
AB On September 7, 2017, three potentially autochthonous cases of chikungunya were notified in the Lazio region. An Outbreak investigation based on established surveillance system data and molecular analysis of viral variant(s) were conducted. Epidemiological analysis suggested the occurrence of 3 main foci of local transmission. The major focus involved 317 cases with epidemiological link with the area of Anzio. The other two foci occurred in Rome (80 cases) and Latina (8 cases). Cumulative incidence in Anzio and Latina were 331.4 and 7.13 per 100,000 residents, respectively. Cumulative incidences ranged from 1.4 to 14.3/100,000 residents in Rome. This is the first report of a chikungunya outbreak involving a densely populated urban area in a western country. The outbreak probably started in Anzio, spread by continuity to neighbouring villages, and then to the metropolitan area of Rome and to the Latina area favoured by the touristic nature of the Anzio area.

AB Left-handers provide unique information about the relationship between cognitive functions because of their larger variability in hemispheric dominance. This study presents the laterality distribution of, correlations between and test-retest reliability of behavioral lateralized language tasks (speech production, reading and speech perception), face recognition tasks, handedness measures and language performance tests based on data from 98 left-handers. The results show that a behavioral test battery leads to percentages of (a) typical dominance that are similar to those found in neuropsychological studies even though the incidence of clear atypical lateralization (about 20%) may be overestimated at the group level. Significant correlations were found between the language tasks for both reaction time and accuracy lateralization indices. The degree of language laterality could however not be linked to face laterality, handedness or language performance. Finally, individuals were classified less consistently than expected as being typical, bilateral or atypical across all tasks. This may be due to the often good (speech production and perception tasks) but sometimes weak (reading and face tasks) test-retest reliabilities. The lack of highly reliable and valid test protocols for functions unrelated to speech remains one of the largest impediments for individual analysis and cross-task investigations in laterality research.

AB We introduce a mathematical model of an absorbing leaky epithelium to reconsider the problem formulated by Diamond and Bossert in 1967: whether "... some distinctive physiological properties of epithelia might arise as geometrical consequences of epithelial ultra-structure". A standing gradient model of the intercellular cleft (IC) is presented that includes tight junctions (TJ) and ion channels uniformly distributed along the whole cleft. This nonlinear system has an intrinsic homogeneous concentration and the spatial scale necessary to establish it along the cleft. These parameters have not been elucidated so far. We further provide non-perturbative analytical approximations for a broad range of parameters. We found that narrowing of the IC increases ion concentration dramatically and can therefore prevent outflow through tight junctions (TJs) and the lateral membrane, as long as extremely high luminal osmolarities are not reached. Our model predicts that the system is to some extent self-regulating and thereby prevents fluxes into the lumen. Recent experimental evidence has shown that liver-intestine (LI) cadherin can control the up/down flux in intestines via regulation of the cleft width. This finding is in full agreement with predictions of our model. We suggest that LI-cadherin may increase water transport through epithelia via sequential narrowing of the cleft, starting from the highest concentration area at the beginning of the cleft and triggering a propagating squeezing motion.

AB We recently identified a novel vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) clone ST736 with reduced daptomycin susceptibility. The objectives of this study were to assess the population dynamics of local VREfm strains and genetic alterations predisposing to daptomycin resistance in VREfm ST736 strains. Multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide variant data were derived from whole-genome sequencing of 250 E. faecium isolates from 1994-1995 (n = 43), 2009-2012 (n = 115) and 2013 (n = 92). A remarkable change was noticed in the clonality and antimicrobial resistance profiles of E. faecium strains between 1994-1995 and 2013. VREfm sequence type 17 (ST17), the prototype strain of clade A1, was the dominant clone (76.7%) recognized in 1994-1995. By contrast, clone ST736 accounted for 46.7% of VREfm isolates, followed by ST18 (26.1%) and ST412 (20.7%) in 2013. Bayesian evolutionary analysis suggested that clone ST736 emerged between 1996 and 2009. Co-mutations (liaR.W73C and liaS.T120A) of the liaFSR system were identified in all ST736 isolates (n = 111, 100%) examined. Thirty-eight (34.2%) ST736 isolates exhibited daptomycin-resistant phenotype, of which 13 isolates had mutations in both the liaFSR and cardiolipin synthase (cls) genes and showed high level of resistance with a daptomycin MIC50 of 32 mu g/mL. The emergence of ST736 strains with mutations predisposing to daptomycin resistance and subsequent clonal spread among inpatients contributed to the observed high occurrence of daptomycin resistance in VREfm at our institution. The expanding geographic distribution of ST736 strains in other states and countries raises concerns about its global dissemination.

AB Low FMR1 variants (CGG(n<26)) have been associated with premature ovarian aging, female infertility and poor IVF treatment success. Until now, there is little published information concerning possible molecular mechanisms for this effect. We wished to examine whether relative expression of RNA and the FMR1 gene's fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) RNA isoforms differ in women with various FMR1 sub-genotypes (normal, low CGG(n<26) and/or high CGG(n >= 34)). This prospective cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 in a clinical research unit of the Center for Human Reproduction in New York City. The study involved a total of 98 study subjects, including 18 young oocyte donors and 80 older infertility patients undergoing routine in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. The main outcome measure was RNA expression in human luteinized granulosa cells of 5 groups of FMRP isoforms. The relative expression of FMR1 RNA in human luteinized granulosa cells was measured by real-time PCR and a possible association with CGG(n) was explored. All 5 groups of FMRP RNA isoforms examined were found to be differentially expressed in human luteinized granulosa cells. The relative expression of four FMR1 RNA isoforms showed significant differences among 6 FMR1 sub-genotypes. Women with at least one low allele expressed significantly lower levels of all 5 sets of FRMP isoforms in comparison to the non-low group. While it would be of interest to see whether FMRP is also decreased in the low-group we recognize that in recent years it has been increasingly documented that information flow of genetics may be regulated by non-coding RNA, that is, without translation to a protein product. We, thus, conclude that various CGG expansions of FMR1 allele may lead to changes of RNA levels and ratios of distinct FMRP RNA isoforms, which could regulate the translation and/or cellular localization of FMRP, affect the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and hormonal receptors, or act in some other epigenetic process and therefore result in the ovarian dysfunction in infertility.

DT Article
ID MUTATIONS; VARIANTS; IDENTIFICATION; CEP290; SERVER; GENE
AB Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and most severe form of all inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) and the most frequent cause of inherited blindness in children. The phenotypic overlap with other early-onset and severe IRDs as well as difficulties associated with the ophthalmic examination of infants can complicate the clinical diagnosis. To date, 25 genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LCA. The disorder is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, although rare dominant cases have been reported. We report the mutation spectra and frequency of genes in 27 German index patients initially diagnosed with LCA. A total of 108 LCA-and other genes implicated in IRD were analysed using a cost-effective targeted next-generation sequencing procedure based on molecular inversion probes (MIPs). Sequencing and variant filtering led to the identification of putative pathogenic variants in 25 cases, thereby leading to a detection rate of 93%. The mutation spectrum comprises 34 different alleles, 17 of which are novel. In line with previous studies, the genetic results led to a revision of the initial clinical diagnosis in a substantial proportion of cases, demonstrating the importance of genetic testing in IRD. In addition, our detection rate of 93% shows that MIPs are a cost-efficient and sensitive tool for targeted next-generation sequencing in IRD.

AB Objective
   Clinician turnover is a major concern as mental health systems and organizations invest substantial resources in the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP). In this study, we identify malleable factors associated with reduced clinician turnover during a system-wide EBP implementation initiative. Specifically, we examine how proficient organizational culture (i.e., norms and behavioral expectations that clinicians prioritize improvement in client well-being and exhibit competence in up-to-date treatment practices), EBP implementation climate (i.e., perceptions that the organization's policies, procedures, and practices support EBP use), and change in these organizational characteristics relate to clinician turnover during a system-wide EBP transformation.
   Method
   Data were collected from 236 clinicians in 19 mental health clinics across 3 years of a system-wide EBP implementation initiative in the City of Philadelphia. Clinicians reported on proficient organizational culture and EBP implementation climate at baseline (T-1) and two-year follow-up (T-2). Administrators reported on clinician turnover at three-year follow-up (T-3). Hypotheses were tested via multilevel mediation analyses incorporating mixed effects logistic regression models.
   Results
   Controlling for organization size, clinician job satisfaction, attitudes towards EBP, job tenure, and age, higher levels of proficient organizational culture and improvement in proficient culture from baseline to two-year follow-up predicted reduced clinician turnover in the year following; these effects were mediated by EBP implementation climate and by improvement in EBP implementation climate, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Organizations with more proficient cultures have more supportive EBP implementation climates that predict reduced clinician turnover during system-wide EBP implementation initiatives. Strategies that target these antecedents in mental health service organizations may contribute to reduced clinician turnover.

TI Push button replication: Is impact evaluation evidence for international
   development verifiable?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FINANCIAL EDUCATION
AB Objective
   Empirical research that cannot be reproduced using the original dataset and software code (replication files) creates a credibility challenge, as it means those published findings are not verifiable. This study reports the results of a research audit exercise, known as the push button replication project, that tested a sample of studies that use similar empirical methods but span a variety of academic fields.
   Methods
   We developed and piloted a detailed protocol for conducting push button replication and determining the level of comparability of these replication findings to original findings. We drew a sample of articles from the ten journals that published the most impact evaluations from low- and middle-income countries from 2010 through 2012. This set includes health, economics, and development journals. We then selected all articles in these journals published in 2014 that meet the same inclusion criteria and implemented the protocol on the sample.
   Results
   Of the 109 articles in our sample, only 27 are push button replicable, meaning the provided code run on the provided dataset produces comparable findings for the key results in the published article. The authors of 59 of the articles refused to provide replication files. Thirty of these 59 articles were published in journals that had replication file requirements in 2014, meaning these articles are non-compliant with their journal requirements. For the remaining 23 of the 109 articles, we confirmed that three had proprietary data, we received incomplete replication files for 15, and we found minor differences in the replication results for five.
   Conclusion
   The findings presented here reveal that many economics, development, and public health researchers are a long way from adopting the norm of open research. Journals do not appear to be playing a strong role in ensuring the availability of replication files.

TI Women's (health) work: A population-based, cross-sectional study of
   gender differences in time spent seeking health care in Malawi
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HOUSEHOLD COSTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; SERVICES; MEN; MONEY
AB Background
   There has been a notable expansion in routine health care in sub-Saharan Africa. While heath care is nominally free in many contexts, the time required to access services reflects an opportunity cost that may be substantial and highly gendered, reflecting the gendered nature of health care guidelines and patterns of use. The time costs of health care use, however, have rarely been systematically assessed at the population-level.
   Methods
   Data come from the 2015 wave of a population-based cohort study of young adults in southern Malawi during which 1,453 women and 407 men between the ages of 21 and 31 were interviewed. We calculated the time spent seeking health care over a two-month period, dis-aggregating findings by men, recently-pregnant women, mothers with children under two years old, and "other women". We then extrapolated the time required for specific services to estimate the time that would be needed for each subpopulation to meet government recommendations for routine health services over the course of a year.
   Results
   Approximately 60% of women and 22% of men attended at least one health care visit during the preceding two months. Women spent six times as long seeking care as did men (t = -4.414, p<0.001), with an average 6.4 hours seeking care over a two-month period compared to 1 hour for men. In order to meet government recommendations for routine health services, HIV-negative women would need to spend between 19 and 63 hours annually seeking health care compared to only three hours for men. An additional 40 hours would be required of HIV-positive individuals initiating antiretroviral care.
   Conclusions
   Women in Malawi spend a considerable amount of time seeking routine health care services, while men spend almost none. The substantial time women spend seeking health care exacerbates their time poverty and constrains opportunities for other meaningful activities. At the same time, few health care guidelines pertain to men who thus have little interaction with the health care system. Additional public health strategies such as integration of services for those services frequently used by women and specific guidelines and outreach for men are urgently needed.

   ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVENTION; EVOLUTION
AB H1N1 is the earliest emerging subtype of influenza A viruses with available genomic sequences, has caused several pandemics and seasonal epidemics, resulting in millions of deaths and enormous economic losses. Timely determination of new antigenic variants is crucial for the vaccine selection and flu prevention. In this study, we chronologically divided the H1N1 strains into several periods in terms of the epidemics and pandemics. Computational models have been constructed to predict antigenic variants based on epidemic and pandemic periods. By sequence analysis, we demonstrated the diverse mutation patterns of HA1 protein on different periods and that an individual model built upon each period can not represent the variations of H1N1 virus. A stacking model was established for the prediction of antigenic variants, combining all the variation patterns across periods, which would help assess a new influenza strain's antigenicity. Three different feature extraction methods, i. e. residue-based, regional band-based and epitope region-based, were applied on the stacking model to verify its feasibility and robustness. The results showed the capability of determining antigenic variants prediction with accuracy as high as 0.908 which performed better than any of the single models. The prediction performance using the stacking model indicates clear distinctions of mutation patterns and antigenicity between epidemic and pandemic strains. It would also facilitate rapid determination of antigenic variants and influenza surveillance.

ID CURVES
AB 3D point cloud registration is a key technology in 3D point cloud processing, such as 3D reconstruction, object detection. Trimmed Iterative Closest Point algorithm is a prevalent method for registration of two partially overlapping clouds. However, it relies heavily on the initial value and is liable to be trapped in to local optimum. In this paper, we adapt the Differential Evolution algorithm to obtain global optimal solution. By design appropriate evolutionary operations, the algorithm can make the populations distributed more widely, and keep the individuals from concentrating to a local optimum. In the experiment, the proposed algorithm is compared with existing methods which are based on global optimization algorithm such as Genetic Algorithm and particle filters. And the results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is more robust and can converge to a good result in fewer generations.

AB This research examined the psychometric properties and construct validity of the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S) in Chinese insurance employees (N = 2,363; 37% males; mean age = 35.14). Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to determine the factor structure of the Grit-S. The resulting model was tested by multi-group CFA for the factorial invariance of the Grit-S across genders and age groups. Results showed that the Grit-S could be best explained by a two-factor model containing consistency of interest (alpha = .70) and perseverance of effort (alpha = .75). The factor model was equivalent across genders and age groups. The scores of the Grit-S were significantly correlated with external criteria variables including mental wellbeing and job performance. Overall, our findings suggested that the Grit-S can be a promising assessment of the grit trait in Chinese employees.

   DYNAMICS
AB Milpas are rain-fed agroecosystems involving domesticated, semi-domesticated and tolerated plant species that combine maize with a large variety of other crop, tree or shrub species. Milpas are low input and low-tillage, yet highly productive agroecosystems, which have been maintained over millennia in indigenous communities in Mexico and other countries in Central America. Thus, milpas may retain ancient plant-microorganisms interactions, which could have been lost in modern high-tillage monocultures with large agrochemical input. In this work, we performed high-throughput 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of soil adjacent to maize roots and bulk soil sampled at 30 cm from the base of the plants. We found that the bacterial communities of maize root soil had a lower alpha diversity, suggesting selection of microorganisms by maize-roots from the bulk-soil community. Beta diversity analysis confirmed that these environments harbor two distinct microbial communities; differences were driven by members of phyla Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria, as well as the order Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria), all of which had higher relative abundance in soil adjacent to the roots. Numerous studies have shown the influence of maize plants on bacterial communities found in soil attached tightly to the roots; here we further show that the influence of maize roots at milpas on bacterial communities is detectable even in plant-free soil collected nearby. We propose that members of Verrucomicrobia and other phyla found in the rhizosphere may establish beneficial plant-microbe interactions with maize roots in milpas, and propose to address their cultivation for future studies on ecology and potential use.

TI Word sense disambiguation using hybrid swarm intelligence approach
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; COLONY OPTIMIZATION; SIMILARITY
AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the process of identifying an appropriate sense for an ambiguous word. With the complexity of human languages in which a single word could yield different meanings, WSD has been utilized by several domains of interests such as search engines and machine translations. The literature shows a vast number of techniques used for the process of WSD. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of meta-heuristic approaches to identify the best solutions that reflect the best sense. However, the application of meta-heuristic approaches remains limited and thus requires the efficient exploration and exploitation of the problem space. Hence, the current study aims to propose a hybrid meta-heuristic method that consists of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing to find the global best meaning of a given text. Different semantic measures have been utilized in this model as objective functions for the proposed hybrid PSO. These measures consist of JCN and extended Lesk methods, which are combined effectively in this work. The proposed method is tested using a three-benchmark dataset (SemCor 3.0, SensEval-2, and SensEval-3). Results show that the proposed method has superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

TI Differential profiles of soluble and cellular toll like receptor (TLR)-2
   and 4 in chronic periodontitis

AB Chronic periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease initiated by a complex microbial biofilm and mediated by the host response causing destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Host recognition of pathogens is mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind conserved molecular patterns shared by large groups of microorganisms. The oral epithelial cells respond to most periodontopathic bacteria via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In addition to the membrane-associated receptors, soluble forms of TLR-2 (sTLR-2) and TLR-4 (sTLR-4) have been identified and are thought to play a regulatory role by binding microbial ligands. sTLR-2 has been shown to arise from ectodomain shedding of the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor and sTLR-4 is thought to be an alternate spliced form. Many studies have previously reported the presence of elevated numbers of viable exfoliated epithelial cells in the saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential value of salivary sTLR-2 and sTLR-4 together with the paired epithelial cell-associated TLR-2/4 mRNA as diagnostic markers for chronic periodontitis. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected after obtaining informed consent from 40 individuals with either periodontitis or gingivitis. The sTLR-2 and sTLR4 in saliva was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TLR-2 and TLR-4 transcript in the epithelial cells in saliva was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction. While levels of sTLR-2 exhibited an inverse correlation, sTLR-4 positively correlated with clinical parameters in the gingivitis cohort. Interestingly, both correlations were lost in the periodontitis cohort indicating a dysregulated host response. On the other hand, while the sTLR-2 and the paired epithelial cell associated TLR-2 mRNA exhibited a direct correlation (r(2) = 0.62), that of sTLR4 and TLR-4 mRNA exhibited an inverse correlation (r(2) = 0.53) in the periodontitis cohort. Collectively, assessments of salivary sTLR2 and sTLR4 together with the respective transcripts in the epithelial cells could provide clinically relevant markers of disease progression from gingivitis to periodontitis.

AB Individual response to stress is correlated with neuroticism and is an important predictor of both neuroticism and the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD). Identification of the genetics underpinning individual differences in response to negative events (stress-sensitivity) may improve our understanding of the molecular pathways involved, and its association with stress-related illnesses. We sought to generate a proxy for stress-sensitivity through modelling the interaction between SNP allele and MDD status on neuroticism score in order to identify genetic variants that contribute to the higher neuroticism seen in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of depression compared to unaffected individuals. Meta-analysis of genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) in UK Biobank (N = 23,092) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (N = 7,155) identified no genome-wide significance SNP interactions. However, gene-based tests identified a genome-wide significant gene, ZNF366, a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptor function implicated in alcohol dependence (p = 1.48x10(-7); Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold p < 2.79x10(-6)). Using summary statistics from the stress-sensitivity term of the GWIS, SNP heritability for stress-sensitivity was estimated at 5.0%. In models fitting polygenic risk scores of both MDD and neuroticism derived from independent GWAS, we show that polygenic risk scores derived from the UK Biobank stress-sensitivity GWIS significantly improved the prediction of MDD in Generation Scotland. This study may improve interpretation of larger genome-wide association studies of MDD and other stress-related illnesses, and the understanding of the etiological mechanisms underpinning stress-sensitivity.

AB The replicability crisis in psychology demands direct replications to test the reliability of relevant phenomena. Prime-to-behavior effects have been an area under intense scrutiny given its surprising results. However, intuitive unsurprising effects have been mostly neglected, while they may lack robustness as well. In the present study, we focused on an intuitive prime-to-behavior effect in which Kay and Ross (2003) used a 2x2 design to test cooperation/competition priming crossed with an explicit/non-explicit construal of a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD). They found a stronger assimilation effect of priming when the situational construal anteceded the decision, but we could not reproduce their findings in the present close replication, despite counting on higher power. Even with limitations due to the unavailability of original materials, this replication presents evidence that questions the existence of the original finding, and highlights the need for further replications to get a deeper understanding of the hypothesized effect.

AB Background
   There is increasing evidence that plant based diets are associated with lower cardiovascular risk.
   Objective
   To evaluate effects of a vegan compared to an omnivorous diet on cardio-metabolic risk factors.
   Methods
   Meta-analysis of observational studies published between 1960 and June 2018 that reported one or more cardio-metabolic risk factors in vegans and controls eating an omnivorous diet were undertaken. Macro-nutrient intake and cardio-metabolic risk factors were compared by dietary pattern. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of each study. The inverse-variance method was used to pool mean differences. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan software version 5.2 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen.
   Results
   40 studies with 12 619 vegans and 179 630 omnivores were included. From food frequency questionnaires in 28 studies, vegans compared to omnivores consumed less energy (-11%, 95% confidence interval -14 to -8) and less saturated fat (- 51%, CI -57 to -45). Compared to controls vegans had a lower body mass index (-1.72 kg/m(2), CI -2.30 to -1.16), waist circumference (-2.35 cm, CI -3.93 to -0.76), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.49 mmol/L CI -0.62 to -0.36), triglycerides (-0.14 mmol/L, CI -0.24 to -0.05), fasting blood glucose (-0.23 mmol/, CI -0.35 to -0.10), and systolic (-2.56 mmHg, CI -4.66 to -0.45) and diastolic blood pressure (-1.33 mmHg, CI -2.67 to -0.02), p<0.0001 for all. Results were consistent for studies with < and >= 50 vegans, and published before and after 2010. However in several large studies from Taiwan a vegan diet was not associated with favourable cardio-metabolic risk factors compared to the control diets.
   Conclusion
   In most countries a vegan diet is associated with a more favourable cardio- metabolic profile compared to an omnivorous diet.

AB Rabies is an ancient and neglected zoonotic disease caused by the rabies virus, a neurotropic RNA virus that belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, genus Lyssavirus. It remains an important public health problem as there are cost and health concerns imposed by the current human post exposure prophylaxis therapy. The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is therefore an attractive alternative. Rabies mostly affects people that reside in resource-limited areas where there are occasional failures in the cold-chain. These environmental changes may upset the stability of the mAbs. This study focused on mAbs 62-71-3 and E559; their structures, responses to freeze/thaw (F/T) and exposure to reactive oxygen species were therefore studied with the aid of a wide range of biophysical and in silico techniques in order to elucidate their stability and identify aggregation prone regions. E559 was found to be less stable than 62-71-3. The complementarity determining regions (CDR) contributed the most to its instability, more specifically: peptides (EIWD102)-E-99 and (92)ATSPYT(97) found in CDR3, Trp33 found in CDR1 and the oxidised Met34. The constant region "(158)SWNSGALTGHTFPAVL(175)" was also flagged by the special aggregation propensity (SAP) tool and F/T experiments to be highly prone to aggregation. The E559 peptides "(4)LQESGSVL(11) from the heavy chain and (4)LTQSPSSL(11) from the light chain, were also highly affected by F/T. These residues may serve as good candidates for mutation, in the aim to bring forward more stable therapeutic antibodies, thus paving a way to a more safe and efficacious antibody-based cocktail treatment against rabies.

AB Populations may become isolated by distance, geographic barriers or both. Isolated populations often diverge in behavioral, morphological and genetic traits as a result of reduced inter-population gene flow. Highland species commonly present naturally fragmented distributions that confine populations to the highest mountain peaks, isolated by mountain passes and distance. The endemic Timberline Wren (Thryorchilus brown!) inhabits the highlands of the Talamanca mountain range, including western Panama, and the highest peak in the Central Volcanic mountain range of Costa Rica. Using microsatellites and song recordings we studied the effect of a geographic barrier and distance on song, genetic and morphological divergence among four populations in Costa Rica. A lowland mountain pass resulted in the largest genetic, vocal, and morphological (bill length) differences among populations, likely due to reduce the gene flow. Cultural drift and assortative mating by females selecting songs from their own population likely accentuates the effect of isolation and limited gene flow between populations. This pattern of population divergence has been found in other Neotropical highland birds, but over larger geographical scales. We conclude that mountain passes and distance both reduce gene flow between populations in recently-isolated highland species with restricted distributions.

AB High levels of trait impulsivity are considered a risk factor for substance abuse and drug addiction. We recently found that non-planning trait impulsivity was negatively correlated with post-commissural putamen volumes in men, but not women, using the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). Here, we attempted to replicate this finding in an independent sample using an updated version of the KSP: the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP). Data from 88 healthy male participants (Mean Age: 28.16 +/- 3.34), who provided structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and self-reported SSP impulsivity scores, were analyzed. Striatal sub-region volumes were acquired using the Multiple Automatically Generated Templates (MAGeT-Brain) algorithm. Contrary to our previous findings trait impulsivity measured using SSP was not a significant predictor of post-commissural putamen volumes (beta = .14, df = 84, p = .94). A replication Bayes Factors analysis strongly supported this null result. Consistent with our previous findings, secondary exploratory analyses found no relationship between ventral striatum volumes and SSP trait impulsivity (beta = -.05, df = 84, p = .28). An exploratory analysis of the other striatal compartments showed that there were no significant associations with trait impulsivity. While we could not replicate our previous findings in the current sample, we believe this work will aide future studies aimed at establishing meaningful brain biomarkers for addiction vulnerability in healthy humans.

TI Assessing the dose-response relationship between number of office-based
   visits and hospitalizations for patients with type II diabetes using
   generalized propensity score matching
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background
   Whether inpatient services can be successfully substituted by office-based services has been debated for many decades, but the evidence is still inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of office-based care on use and the expenditure for other healthcare services in patients with type II diabetes (T2D).
   Methods
   A generalized propensity score matching approach was used on pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data for 2000-2012 to explore a dose-response effect. Patients were matched by using a comprehensive set of variables selected following a standard model on access to care.
   Findings
   Office-based care (up to 5 visits/year) acts as a substitute for other healthcare services and is associated with lower use and expenditure for inpatient, outpatient and emergency care. After five visits, office-based care becomes a complement to other services and is associated with increases in expenditure for T2D. Above 20 to 26 visits per year, depending on the healthcare service under consideration, the marginal effect of an additional office-based visit becomes non-statistically significant.
   Conclusions
   Office-based visits appear to be an effective instrument to reduce use of inpatient care and other services, including outpatient and emergency-care, in patients with T2D without any increase in total healthcare expenditure.

AB Diarrhea due to infection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is of great concern in several low and middle-income countries. ETEC infection is considered to be the most common cause of diarrhea in Bangladesh and is mainly spread through contaminated water and food. ETEC pathogenesis is mediated by the expression of enterotoxins and colonization factors (CFs) that target the intestinal mucosa. ETEC can survive for extended time periods in water, where they are likely to be attacked by bacteriophages. Antibiotic resistance is common amongst enteric pathogens and therefore is the use of bacteriophages (phage) as a therapeutic tool an interesting approach. This study was designed to identify novel phages that specifically target ETEC virulence factors. In total, 48 phages and 195 ETEC isolates were collected from water sources and stool samples. Amongst the identified ETEC specific phages, an enterobacteria phage T7, designated as IMM-002, showed a significant specificity towards colonization factor CS3-expressing ETEC isolates. Antibody-blocking and phage-neutralization assays revealed that CS3 is used as a host receptor for the IMM-002 phage. The bacterial CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-associated) defence mechanism can invoke immunity against phages. Genomic analyses coupled with plaque assay experiments indicate that the ETEC CRISPR-Cas system is involved in the resistance against the CS3-specific phage (IMM-002) and the previously identified CS7-specific phage (IMM-001). As environmental water serves as a reservoir for ETEC, it is important to search for new antimicrobial agents such as phages in environmental water as well as the human gut. A better understanding of how the interplay between ETEC-specific phages and ETEC isolates affects the ETEC diversity, both in environmental ecosystems and within the host, is important for the development of new treatments for ETEC infections.

AB The possible effect of directional larval swimming on the recruitment success of the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, was examined with a three-dimensional particle-tracking ocean circulation model using horizontal northwestward swimming and diel vertical migration (DVM). Four separate experiments included virtual larvae (v-larvae) movement from the spawning area over 290 days (total migration) and 160 days (stage A), from the STCC eddy region in 70 days (stage B), and from the origin of the Kuroshio in 60 days (stage C) to evaluate the effect of directional swimming and DVM compared to simple drifting. Passive or random swimming were not the most effective strategies for larvae dispersing from the spawning area because most v-larvae remained south of 20 degrees N without entering the Kuroshio. Northwestward swimming resulted in wider dispersion and a better chance of successful recruitment, with v-larvae becoming widely distributed in the STCC eddy zone, arriving at the east coast of the Philippines (stage A), escaping the STCC eddy area and reaching the Kuroshio (stage B), and crossing the Kuroshio into the East China Sea shelf (stage C). DVM slightly shortened the migration period due to faster shallow layer ocean currents during nighttime. The NEC transported non-swimming v-larvae westward to the Kuroshio and occasionally northward into the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) area where eddies transported v-larvae westward into the Kuroshio, but less than with swimming. Directional swimming increased recruitment success, northwestward swimming was more effective than other directions, and a slower swimming speed was still better than no/random swimming in sensitivity tests. The present study demonstrated a first view of the possibility that Japanese eel larvae might be able to use a strategy of single-direction swimming to increase arrival at their recruitment areas.

ID BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; PERSPECTIVES; RESPONSES
AB Aquatic microorganisms are an important part of aquatic ecosystems because they are involved in nutrient cycling and water quality, eventually influencing fish productivity. However, at present, reports on the effect of stocking density on microorganisms in sediment samples in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are relatively rare. In this study, the changes in the microbial community in an RAS were investigated under different stocking densities of juvenile hybrid grouper (female Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x male Epinephelus lanceolatus). Total DNA was extracted from the sediment samples, the 16S rDNA gene was amplified, and the bacterial community was analysed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. We identified 741 OTUs from a total of 409,031 reads. Based on the analysis of bacterial composition, richness, diversity, bacterial 16S and rDNA gene abundance; sediment sample comparisons; and the existence of specific bacterial taxa within four densities, we concluded that the dominant phyla in all samples were similar and included: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi. However, their relative distributions differed at different fish densities. Linear discriminant analysis further indicated that the stocking treatment influenced the sediment bacterial community. This study indicates that under RAS aquaculture, mode density is a factor regulating the microbial community, which provides insights into microbe management in RAS culture.

AB The fertility of men with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is reduced. Despite this observation, gonadal function has not been examined in patients with NF1. In order to assess the role of reduced neurofibromin in the testes, we examined testicular morphology and function in an Nf1(+/- )mouse model. We found that although Nf1(+/- )male mice are able to reproduce, they have significantly fewer pups per litter than Nf1(+/+) control males. Reduced fertility in Nf1(+/-) male mice is associated with disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium, with exfoliation of germ cells and immature spermatids into the tubule lumen. Morphometric analysis shows that these alterations are associated with decreased Leydig cell numbers and increased spermatid cell numbers. We hypothesized that hyper-activation of Ras in Nf1(+/-) males affects ectoplasmic specialization, a Sertoli-spermatid adherens junction involved in spermiation. Consistent with this idea, we found increased expression of phosphorylated ERK, a downstream effector of Ras that has been shown to alter ectoplasmic specialization, in Nf1(+/-) males in comparison to control Nf1(+/+) littermates. These data demonstrate that neurofibromin haploinsufficiency impairs spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model of NF1.

AB Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated +/- PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Meta-boanalyst. Cell number and number of scans (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110 metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates, carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and lipid-like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and glycolysis, suggesting a redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent respiratory burst. We have developed protocols for the study of human neutrophils by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, this methodology has sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility to detect changes in metabolite abundance from cell numbers typically collected from clinical samples or experiments with multiple assay conditions.

AB The full-length members of the Groucho/Transducin-like Enhancer of split gene family, namely Grg1-4, encode nuclear corepressors that act either directly, via interaction with transcription factors, or indirectly by modifying histone acetylation or chromatin structure. In this work we describe a detailed expression analysis of Grg1-4 family members during embryonic neurogenesis in the developing murine telencephalon. Grg1-4 presented a unique, complex yet overlapping expression pattern; Grg1 and Grg3 were mainly detected in the proliferative zones of the telencephalon, Grg2 mainly in the subpallium and finally, Grg4 mainly in the subpallial post mitotic neurons. In addition, comparative analysis of the expression of Grg1-4 revealed that, at these stages, distinct telencephalic progenitor domains or structures are characterized by the presence of different combinations of Grg repressors, thus forming a "Grg-mediated repression map".

AB This retrospective study evaluated the expression of beta 1 integrins and associated proteins as prognostic markers for primary radio(chemo)therapy outcome of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Tissue microarrays were prepared from 224 HNSCC patients undergoing curative primary radio(chemo)therapy from 1996 to 2005. Staining intensities of beta 1 integrin and its downstream-proteins FAK, phosphorylated FAK as well as the beta 1 integrin ECM ligands fibronectin and collagen type-I were determined. Their association to the primary endpoint loco-regional control and the secondary endpoints overall survival and freedom from distant metastasis was analyzed by Cox regression. None of the considered molecular parameters showed a significant association with loco-regional control and freedom from distant metastasis. Patients with p16 positive tumors or tumors with a low intensity of fibronectin showed significantly higher overall survival in univariable regression. In multivariable regression including additional clinical parameters, however, these parameters were not significantly associated with overall survival. Our study in a HNSCC patient cohort treated with primary radio(chemo)therapy does not reveal a prognostic value of beta 1 integrin expression.

TI Ambulatory assessment of phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction using

SO PLOS ONE

AB Phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH) is associated with chronic misuse and/or abuse of voice that can result in lesions such as vocal fold nodules. The clinical aerodynamic assessment of vocal function has been recently shown to differentiate between patients with PVH and healthy controls to provide meaningful insight into pathophysiological mechanisms associated with these disorders. However, all current clinical assessment of PVH is incomplete because of its inability to objectively identify the type and extent of detrimental phonatory function that is associated with PVH during daily voice use. The current study sought to address this issue by incorporating, for the first time in a comprehensive ambulatory assessment, glottal airflow parameters estimated from a neck-mounted accelerometer and recorded to a smartphone-based voice monitor. We tested this approach on 48 patients with vocal fold nodules and 48 matched healthy-control subjects who each wore the voice monitor for a week. Seven glottal airflow features were estimated every 50 ms using an impedance-based inverse filtering scheme, and seven high-order summary statistics of each feature were computed every 5 minutes over voiced segments. Based on a univariate hypothesis testing, eight glottal airflow summary statistics were found to be statistically different between patient and healthy-control groups. L-1-regularized logistic regression for a supervised classification task yielded a mean (standard deviation) area under the ROC curve of 0.82 (0.25) and an accuracy of 0.83 (0.14). These results outperform the state-ofthe-art classification for the same classification task and provide a new avenue to improve the assessment and treatment of hyperfunctional voice disorders.

TI The Nox1/Nox4 inhibitor attenuates acute lung injury induced by

AB Lung ischemia and reperfusion injury (LIRI) were mediated by several processes including over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory activation. ROS generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucletide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) may play a pivotal role in pathophysiological changes in a range of disease. However, it was poorly understood in LIRI. Thus, the purpose of our study was to explore whether GKT137831, as a special dual inhibitor of Nox1 and 4, could alleviate LIRI in mice model and explore the minimal dose. According to the protocol, this study was divided into two parts. The first part was to determine the minimal dose of Nox1/4 inhibitor in attenuating LIRI via histopathology and apoptosis analysis. Eighteen C57BL/6J male wild-type mice were randomly divided in to sham, 2.5Nox+sham, 5.0Nox+sham, IR, 2.5Nox+IR and 5.0Nox+IR groups. According to the different group, mice were pretreated with corresponding dose of Nox1/4 inhibitors or normal saline. After LIRI, the results showed 5.0mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor could be considered as the minimal dose to alleviate injury by decreasing of lung injury score and the number of TUNEL-positive cells. The second part was to further verify the benefit of 5.0mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor in lung protective effects. Thirty-seven C57BL/6J male wild-type mice were divided in to sham, IR and 5.0Nox+IR groups randomly. The results showed that expressions of inflammatory, autophagy cytokines were markedly elevated and PH value was declined after LIRI. However, 5.0 mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor significantly attenuated cytokine production as reflected by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and Q-PCR analysis. In conclusion, our findings suggested that 5.0mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor contributed to protect lung tissue damage after LIRI via the suppression of inflammatory and autophagy activation.

AB A clinical isolate of Aspergillus thermomutatus (Teleomorph: Neosartorya pseudofischen) was found to contain similar to 35 nm isometric virus-like particles associated with four double-stranded (ds) RNA segments, each of which coded for a single open reading frame. The longest dsRNA element (3589 nt) encodes a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1114 aa), the second longest dsRNA element (2772 nt) encodes a coat protein (825 aa), and the other two dsRNAs (2676 nt, 2514 nt) encode hypothetical proteins of 768 aa and 711 aa, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences showed 41-60% similarity to the proteins coded by the dsRNAs of the most closely related virus, Penicillium janczewskii chrysovirus 2, indicating that it is a new species based on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for the genus Chrysovirus. This is the first virus reported from A. thermomutatus and was tentatively named Aspergillus thermomutatus chrysovirus 1. A virus free line of the fungal isolate, cured by cycloheximide treatment, produced large numbers of conidia but no ascospores at both 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C, whereas the virus infected line produced ten-fold fewer conidia at 20 degrees C and a large number of ascospores at both temperatures. The effects of the virus on fungal sporulation have interesting implications for the spread of the fungus and possible use of the virus as a biological control agent.

AB Background
   Recently, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used as a safe and efficient method for the treatment of and immunization against asthma and various allergies. However, the routes of antigen/allergen (particulate antigen) uptake through the mucosa of the oral cavity remain incompletely understood, as do the roles of sex and age in the process. For this purpose, to elucidate the mechanism and efficacy of SLIT among different sexes and ages, microbeads were dripped into the sublingual region to mimic particulate antigen uptake by the sublingual mucosa.
   Methods
   Twenty microliters of either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or fluorescently labelled microbeads (latex and silica beads) were placed under the tongue of both male and female C57BL/6 mice at young (3 months) and old (6 months) ages. The lower jaw was examined 30 min after administration, and beads were detected with a fluorescence stereomicro-scope. Morphological observations of the mucosa of the fluorescent areas were made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an all-in-one light fluorescence microscope (LM). Fluorescence intensity was compared between both sexes and ages.
   Results
   Stereomicroscopic observation revealed fluorescent illuminations in three compartments of the sublingual mucosa: the sublingual caruncles (SC), the oral rostral mucosa (OR) and the buccal mucosa (BM). Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity tended to be higher among females than among males in the SC region in particular. However, there were no significant age-related differences. SEM and LM revealed beads in the lumina of both mandibular ducts and sublingual ducts (Sd). Additionally, the apical cytoplasm of some Sd cells contained silica beads. However, there was no specification in the OR mucosa or BM.
   Conclusions
   This study reveals the major role Sd plays in local immunity via the antigen uptake mechanisms. Furthermore, our data suggest that the efficacy of SLIT in humans could be affected by sex.

TI Next generation viscoelasticity assays in cardiothoracic surgery:
   Feasibility of the TEG6s system

AB Background
   Viscoelastic near-patient assays of global hemostasis have been found useful and cost-effective in perioperative settings. Shortcomings of current systems include substantial laboratory intensity, user-dependent reproducibility, relatively large sample volumes, sensitivity to ambient vibration and limited comparability between techniques and devices. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of a new, resonance-based viscoelastic whole blood methodology (TEG6s) in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and to compare the parameters this system produces with the ROTEM delta system and standard coagulation tests.
   Methods
   In a prospective evaluation study, twenty-three consecutive cardiac surgery patients underwent hemostasis management according to current guidelines, using the ROTEM delta system and standard coagulation tests. Blood samples were collected prior to CPB before anesthetic induction (pre-CPB), during CPB on rewarming (CPB), and 10 minutes after heparin reversal with protamine (post-CPB). ROTEM and standard coagulation test results were compared with TEG6s parameters, which were concurrently determined using its multi-channel microfluidic cartridge system.
   Results
   TEG6s provided quantifiable results pre-CPB and post-CPB, but only R (clotting time) of CKH (kaolin with heparinase) was measurable during CPB (full heparinization). Spearman's correlation coefficient (r(s)) was 0.78 for fibrinogen levels and MA CFF (functional fibrinogen). Correlation of several TEG6s parameters was good (0.77 to 0.91) with MCF FIBTEM, and poor (<0.56) with prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time (<0.44). R-s with platelet count was moderate (0.70, MA CK; 0.73, MA CRT). Accuracy of MA CFF for detection of fibrinogen deficiency < 1.5 g/L was high (ROC-AUC 0.93).
   Conclusions
   The TEG6s system, which is based on resonance viscoelastic methodology, appears to be feasible for POC hemostasis assessment in cardiac surgery. Its correlations with standard coagulation parameters are quite similar to those of ROTEM and there is good diagnostic accuracy for fibrinogen levels lower than 1.5 g/L. During full heparinization, TEG6s testing is limited to R measurement. Larger studies are needed to assess superiority over other POC systems.

TI Statin therapy in the treatment of active cancer: A systematic review

AB Background
   Preclinical evidence suggests statins may have anti-tumor properties. Large observational studies are also consistent with improved survival and cancer-specific outcomes among cancer patients on statins. We sought to evaluate the randomized controlled trials of statins in addition to usual anti-cancer therapy.
   Methods
   A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Papers First and Clinicaltrials. gov was performed from inception through to July 4, 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials that investigated statin therapy in cancer patients. Our primary outcome was overall survival and our secondary outcome was progression-free survival. We calculated summary hazard ratio's (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on random-effects models using aggregate data. PROSPERO (CRD42017065503).
   Results
   Ten studies with 1,881 individuals were included with 1,572 deaths and a median follow-up of 23 months. All trials included patients with advanced (stage 3 or higher) disease. There was minimal between-study statistical heterogeneity (I-2 = 1.8%, for OS; I-2 = 0%, for PFS). The pooled HR for overall survival in patients randomized to statins plus standard anti-cancer therapy versus standard therapy alone was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.04). In the 9 studies that reported progression-free survival (1,798 participants), the pooled HR for statin plus standard therapy versus standard therapy alone was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07).
   Conclusions In patients with advanced cancer and a prognosis < 2 years, the addition of statins to standard anti-cancer therapy does not appear to improve overall survival or progression-free survival. Future research should assess if cancer patients with better prognosis benefit from longer-term statin therapy.

TI Open source software in quantum computing
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
AB Open source software is becoming crucial in the design and testing of quantum algorithms. Many of the tools are backed by major commercial vendors with the goal to make it easier to develop quantum software: this mirrors how well-funded open machine learning frameworks enabled the development of complex models and their execution on equally complex hardware. We review a wide range of open source software for quantum computing, covering all stages of the quantum toolchain from quantum hardware interfaces through quantum compilers to implementations of quantum algorithms, as well as all quantum computing paradigms, including quantum annealing, and discrete and continuous-variable gate-model quantum computing. The evaluation of each project covers characteristics such as documentation, licence, the choice of programming language, compliance with norms of software engineering, and the culture of the project. We find that while the diversity of projects is mesmerizing, only a few attract external developers and even many commercially backed frameworks have shortcomings in software engineering. Based on these observations, we highlight the best practices that could foster a more active community around quantum computing software that welcomes newcomers to the field, but also ensures high-quality, well-documented code.
